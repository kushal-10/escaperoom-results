If the current room seems similar to the ESCAPE ROOM but you are uncertain, ask me a clarifying question that focuses on visually distinguishing\nfeatures that can help you tell your current room apart from the ESCAPE ROOM described.\nRespond strictly with -\nQUESTION: your question\n\n3. If the current room is definitely not the ESCAPE ROOM, choose a direction from the available options: ['west', 'east']\nreply strictly with -\nMOVE: chosen direction\n\nWhat action do you choose?\n\nYou must follow the above format rules exactly.\nDo not respond in any other format. Do not provide any commentary or clarification.\n\n", "label": "context"}}, {"from": "Player 2 (Explorer)", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-07-18T21:10:58.375085", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "QUESTION: Are there any visible soundproofing panels and speakers in the room?", "label": "response"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-07-18T21:10:58.375483", "action": {"type": "question", "content": "explorer"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-07-18T21:10:58.375544", "action": {"type": "image", "content": {"image": ["https://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/clembench/adk/images/ADE/training/home_or_hotel/home_theater/ADE_train_00009419.jpg"]}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1 (Guide)", "timestamp": "2025-07-18T21:10:58.375641", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "question: are there any visible soundproofing panels and speakers in the room?", "label": "context"}}, {"from": "Player 1 (Guide)", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-07-18T21:11:02.364515", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "ANSWER: yes, there are visible soundproofing panels and speakers in the room.", "label": "response"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-07-18T21:11:02.364861", "action": {"type": "answer", "content": "guide"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-07-18T21:11:02.364969", "action": {"type": "image", "content": {"image": ["https://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/clembench/adk/images/ADE/training/home_or_hotel/basement/ADE_train_00002500.jpg"]}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "Player 2 (Explorer)", "timestamp": "2025-07-18T21:11:02.365009", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "answer: yes, there are visible soundproofing panels and speakers in the room", "label": "context"}}, {"from": "Player 2 (Explorer)", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-07-18T21:11:06.637945", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "QUESTION: Is the room equipped with a large wall-mounted screen displaying a woman in a yellow top?", "label": "response"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-07-18T21:11:06.638339", "action": {"type": "question", "content": "explorer"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-07-18T21:11:06.638400", "action": {"type": "image", "content": {"image": ["https://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/clembench/adk/images/ADE/training/home_or_hotel/home_theater/ADE_train_00009419.jpg"]}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1 (Guide)", "timestamp": "2025-07-18T21:11:06.638497", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "question: is the room equipped with a large wall-mounted screen displaying a woman in a yellow top?", "label": "context"}}, {"from": "Player 1 (Guide)", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-07-18T21:11:11.333391", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "ANSWER: yes, the room is equipped with a large wall-mounted screen displaying a woman in a yellow top.", "label": "response"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-07-18T21:11:11.333727", "action": {"type": "answer", "content": "guide"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-07-18T21:11:11.333824", "action": {"type": "image", "content": {"image": ["https://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/clembench/adk/images/ADE/training/home_or_hotel/basement/ADE_train_00002500.jpg"]}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "Player 2 (Explorer)", "timestamp": "2025-07-18T21:11:11.333864", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "answer: yes, the room is equipped with a large wall-mounted screen displaying a woman in a yellow top", "label": "context"}}, {"from": "Player 2 (Explorer)", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-07-18T21:11:12.505981", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "", "label": "response"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-07-18T21:11:12.506314", "action": {"type": "invalid value", "content": "abort game: explorer"}}]]}
