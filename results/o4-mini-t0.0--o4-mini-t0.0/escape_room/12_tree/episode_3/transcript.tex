	 DESCRIPTION: The room appears to be a reception area with a light wood front desk stretching across the foreground. Behind the desk sits a person working, with two warm pendant lights hanging overhead. On either side of the person are built-in shelving units filled with books, decorative sculptures, a clock, and small urns. To the left of the desk is a set of windows and a door leading into another space, and above that a small security camera is mounted on patterned wallpaper. The floor in front of the desk combines a dark carpeted area with lighter tile by the entry, and the ceiling has recessed lighting and skylights. A small arrangement of potted plants sits atop the right side of the desk.
