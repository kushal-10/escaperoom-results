	 DESCRIPTION: A home studio–style escape room featuring white walls and wood flooring overlaid by a patterned area rug. Centered against the back wall is a two-tiered light-wood desk with black metal supports. On the upper shelf sit two computer monitors—a bulky CRT displaying music-production software on the left and a flat-panel LCD on the right—with a small digital clock beneath them. The lower work surface holds a computer keyboard and mouse on a sliding tray, a full-size MIDI keyboard controller, a small audio mixer, and a control-surface pad. To the right of the controller are rack components including a stereo receiver, CD player, and a cassette deck, alongside a rack-mountable disc drive. Four studio-monitor speakers on tall stands flank the desk—two larger ones at the far left and right, with smaller satellite speakers directly beside each monitor. Below the desk reside a computer tower, a separate electronics box, power strips and tangled cables, and a laser printer on the right. A partial nature poster peeks out on the right wall.
