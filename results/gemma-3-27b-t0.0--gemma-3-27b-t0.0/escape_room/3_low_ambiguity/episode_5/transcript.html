        <p>DESCRIPTION: The image shows a recording studio. There&#x27;s a large mixing console dominating the center of the room, with various pieces of audio equipment surrounding it. A television is mounted high on the wall. To the right of the console is a wooden cabinet with more audio gear, and a small table with a telephone on it.
