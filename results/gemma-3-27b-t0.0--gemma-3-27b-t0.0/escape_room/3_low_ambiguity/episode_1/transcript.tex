	 ANSWER: There is no table or teddy bear visible in the image. Behind where a table *might* be (based on your question), the wall is covered in highly ornate gold sculpting and relief work. The colors are primarily gold, cream, and shades of brown/darker tones within the sculpted details. I do not see any distinct shapes or numbers displayed within the wall decorations – it's mostly figures and floral patterns within the relief work.
