	 DESCRIPTION: The image shows a long, straight hallway with doors lining both sides. The walls are primarily white with a section of lime green at the far end. There are recessed lights in the ceiling, and a large, concrete pillar stands prominently on the right side of the hallway, closer to the viewer. The floor is a dark, polished material, likely wood or linoleum, and reflects the light. The hallway appears to be in a modern or institutional building. There is a small, dark opening

The walls are primarily white with a section of lime green at the far end. There are recessed lights in the ceiling, and a large, concrete pillar stands prominently on the right side of the hallway, closer to the viewer. The floor is a dark, polished material, likely wood or linoleum, and reflects the light. The hallway appears to be in a modern or institutional building. There is a small, dark opening.\\ \tt \\ \tt Based on my description and the image given, you now have three options\\ \tt \\ \tt First Option - If you think that the description of my image matches the image you have, i.e.\\ \tt you are in the escape room then respond with one word - ESCAPE.\\ \tt \\ \tt Second Option - If you think you need more details from my image - respond in the following format\\ \tt QUESTION: Ask details about the image I have to verify if we have the same image or not\\ \tt \\ \tt Third Option - If you think you are in a different room than what I have, i.e we are seeing different images,\\ \tt then you can make a move in following Directions - ['north', 'south']. Respond in the following format\\ \tt MOVE: direction - Here direction can be one of {north, south, east, west}\\ \tt
