There's a dark wood bookshelf filled with books on the left, and a sewing machine on a desk with a green chair in front of it. To the right of the bookshelf is a dark, decorative screen. Further to the right is a wooden shelving unit filled with various items like jars, boxes, and figurines. A glass display cabinet sits between the shelving unit and the screen. A painting hangs on the wall above.\\ \tt \\ \tt Based on my description and the image given, you now have three options\\ \tt \\ \tt First Option - If you think that the description of my image matches the image you have, i.e.\\ \tt you are in the escape room then respond with one word - ESCAPE.\\ \tt \\ \tt Second Option - If you think you need more details from my image - respond in the following format\\ \tt QUESTION: Ask details about the image I have to verify if we have the same image or not\\ \tt \\ \tt Third Option - If you think you are in a different room than what I have, i.e we are seeing different images,\\ \tt then you can make a move in following Directions - ['south', 'north']. Respond in the following format\\ \tt MOVE: direction - Here direction can be one of {north, south, east, west}\\ \tt
