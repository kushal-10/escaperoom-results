	 DESCRIPTION: The image shows what appears to be a basement or utility room. There are light-colored wooden cabinets along the left wall, both upper and lower. A white refrigerator stands against the right wall, and a green trash can is on the floor near it. A broom, shovel, and mop are hanging on hooks on the center wall. There's also a small table with items on it, and a fluorescent light fixture on the ceiling. The floor is a light concrete color.

	 You are stuck in a mapworld environment containing several rooms. \\ \tt Your task is to explore this world and reach an escape room.\\ \tt You are always given an image of the current room you are in. \\ \tt I have an image of the Escape Room, this is an initial description of my image - DESCRIPTION: The image shows what appears to be a basement or utility room. There are light-colored wooden cabinets along the left wall, both upper and lower. A white refrigerator stands against the right wall, and a green trash can is on the floor near it. A broom, shovel, and mop are hanging on hooks on the center wall. There's also a small table with items on it, and a fluorescent light fixture on the ceiling. The floor is a light concrete color.\\ \tt \\ \tt Based on my description and the image given, you now have three options\\ \tt \\ \tt First Option - If you think that the description of my image matches the image you have, i.e.\\ \tt you are in the escape room then respond with one word - ESCAPE.\\ \tt \\ \tt Second Option - If you think you need more details from my image - respond in the following format\\ \tt QUESTION: Ask details about the image I have to verify if we have the same image or not\\ \tt \\ \tt Third Option - If you think you are in a different room than what I have, i.e we are seeing different images,\\ \tt then you can make a move in following Directions - ['north', 'east']. Respond in the following format\\ \tt MOVE: direction - Here direction can be one of {north, south, east, west}\\ \tt
