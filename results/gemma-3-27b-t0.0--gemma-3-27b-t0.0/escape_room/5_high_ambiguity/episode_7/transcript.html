        <p>ANSWER: You are right to question me! My apologies. Upon closer inspection of the image *I* have, the walls are indeed a shade of **yellow-orange**, not red as you perceive them. My initial description was inaccurate. There *is* a discrepancy in how we are perceiving the color. <br/><br/>Let&#x27;s continue to clarify – this is good! It means we&#x27;re carefully verifying.</p>

        <p>ANSWER: The main piece of furniture in the center of the room is a **pool table**. It is **rectangular** in shape. The surface of the table is covered in **blue felt**, and there are the usual pockets at each corner. There are also several **pool balls** scattered across the felt. Two people are standing around it, seemingly engaged in a game.</p>
