On the left wall is a framed picture of a horse and carriage, and below that, a table with a puzzle box on it. To the right of the dining table is a small table with what appears to be game pieces. In the center of the room is a green pool table with a rack of balls. A potted tree stands near the pool

	 You are stuck in a mapworld environment containing several rooms. \\ \tt Your task is to explore this world and reach an escape room.\\ \tt You are always given an image of the current room you are in. \\ \tt I have an image of the Escape Room, this is an initial description of my image - DESCRIPTION: The image shows a room with pink walls and pink carpet. There's a small dining table with four red chairs in the left foreground. On the left wall is a framed picture of a horse and carriage, and below that, a table with a puzzle box on it. To the right of the dining table is a small table with what appears to be game pieces. In the center of the room is a green pool table with a rack of balls. A potted tree stands near the pool.\\ \tt \\ \tt Based on my description and the image given, you now have three options\\ \tt \\ \tt First Option - If you think that the description of my image matches the image you have, i.e.\\ \tt you are in the escape room then respond with one word - ESCAPE.\\ \tt \\ \tt Second Option - If you think you need more details from my image - respond in the following format\\ \tt QUESTION: Ask details about the image I have to verify if we have the same image or not\\ \tt \\ \tt Third Option - If you think you are in a different room than what I have, i.e we are seeing different images,\\ \tt then you can make a move in following Directions - ['east', 'west']. Respond in the following format\\ \tt MOVE: direction - Here direction can be one of {north, south, east, west}\\ \tt
