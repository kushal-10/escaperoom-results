The walls are white. There's a bed with a white sheet and a white pillow, and a white plastic chair. A small, older-model television is mounted on the wall, with a cable hanging down. To the left of the TV, there's a painting of a figure in a red dress.

Respond in the following format\\ \tt MOVE: direction - Here direction can be one of {north, south, east, west}\\ \tt
