Two wooden Adirondack-style chairs with pink patterned cushions are facing outwards towards lush green foliage. A smaller, ornate white metal chair is positioned near the edge of the porch. A glass sliding door with a silver handle is visible on the left side of the image. A hanging wall decoration is visible on the wall next to the door. The overall scene is bright and filled with greenery.

There are wooden deck boards forming the floor. Two wooden Adirondack-style chairs with pink patterned cushions are facing outwards towards lush green foliage. A smaller, ornate white metal chair is positioned near the edge of the porch. A glass sliding door with a silver handle is visible on the left side of the image. A hanging wall decoration is visible on the wall next to the door.
