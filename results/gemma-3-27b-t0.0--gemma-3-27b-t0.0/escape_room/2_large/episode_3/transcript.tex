	 DESCRIPTION: The image shows a building with a terracotta tile roof and a stucco exterior, likely in a Mediterranean or Spanish style. There's a patio area with white tables and chairs set amongst potted plants. A set of red brick stairs leads up to an arched entryway. The building has several arched windows. There's also a glimpse of other buildings and greenery in the background, and a partial view of a patio umbrella on the right side of the image. It appears to be a sunny day.
