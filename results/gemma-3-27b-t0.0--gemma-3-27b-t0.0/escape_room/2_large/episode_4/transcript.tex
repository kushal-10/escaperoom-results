There's a large wooden bed with a patterned bedspread, two bedside tables each with a lamp, and a painting on the wall above the bed. A wooden framed picture is also on the wall to the left. There's a door on the right side of the image and a glimpse of something outside the door. The floor appears to be wooden. \\ \tt \\ \tt Now, ask me your first question!
