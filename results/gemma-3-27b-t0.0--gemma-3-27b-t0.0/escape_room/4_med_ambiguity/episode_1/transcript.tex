A window with white curtains is visible on the right side of the image, looking out into darkness. On the left wall, there's a lamp and a chair. Two framed pictures hang on the wall between the window and the lamp. A small side table sits between the chairs. The floor is covered with a patterned rug and dark hardwood flooring

There are several armchairs and a sofa arranged around a dark wooden coffee table. A window with white curtains is visible on the right side of the image, looking out into darkness. On the left wall, there's a lamp and a chair. Two framed pictures hang on the wall between the window and the lamp. A small side table sits between the chairs. The floor is covered with a patterned rug and dark hardwood flooring.\\ \tt \\ \tt Based on my description and the image given, you now have three options\\ \tt \\ \tt First Option - If you think that the description of my image matches the image you have, i.e.\\ \tt you are in the escape room then respond with one word - ESCAPE.\\ \tt \\ \tt Second Option - If you think you need more details from my image - respond in the following format\\ \tt QUESTION: Ask details about the image I have to verify if we have the same image or not\\ \tt \\ \tt Third Option - If you think you are in a different room than what I have, i.e we are seeing different images,\\ \tt then you can make a move in following Directions - ['north', 'south']. Respond in the following format\\ \tt MOVE: direction - Here direction can be one of {north, south, east, west}\\ \tt
