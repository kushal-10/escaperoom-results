	 DESCRIPTION: The image shows a hallway viewed through an open doorway. The hallway has wooden flooring and peach-colored walls. There are two wooden doors visible in the hallway – one is slightly ajar on the left, and another is closed further down the hall on the right. Between these doors, there's a small framed picture hanging on the wall. To the right of the closed door, another doorway is visible, leading into a darker room. A small rug is on the floor near the end

	 You are stuck in a mapworld environment containing several rooms. \\ \tt Your task is to explore this world and reach an escape room.\\ \tt You are always given an image of the current room you are in. \\ \tt I have an image of the Escape Room, this is an initial description of my image - DESCRIPTION: The image shows a hallway viewed through an open doorway. The hallway has wooden flooring and peach-colored walls. There are two wooden doors visible in the hallway – one is slightly ajar on the left, and another is closed further down the hall on the right. Between these doors, there's a small framed picture hanging on the wall. To the right of the closed door, another doorway is visible, leading into a darker room. A small rug is on the floor near the end.\\ \tt \\ \tt Based on my description and the image given, you now have three options\\ \tt \\ \tt First Option - If you think that the description of my image matches the image you have, i.e.\\ \tt you are in the escape room then respond with one word - ESCAPE.\\ \tt \\ \tt Second Option - If you think you need more details from my image - respond in the following format\\ \tt QUESTION: Ask details about the image I have to verify if we have the same image or not\\ \tt \\ \tt Third Option - If you think you are in a different room than what I have, i.e we are seeing different images,\\ \tt then you can make a move in following Directions - ['north', 'east']. Respond in the following format\\ \tt MOVE: direction - Here direction can be one of {north, south, east, west}\\ \tt
