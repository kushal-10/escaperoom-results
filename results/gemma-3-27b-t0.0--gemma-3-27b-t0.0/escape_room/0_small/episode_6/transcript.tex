	 DESCRIPTION: The image shows a room decorated in a rustic, cabin-like style. The most prominent feature is a large, textured fireplace with a bear head mounted above it. To the left of the fireplace is a dark wooden wardrobe with a mirror on the wall above it. A bed with a colorful quilt dominates the foreground. There are two chairs, one with a red cushion, and a small table. The walls are designed to look like log cabin walls, and there are windows letting in light.

	 You are stuck in a mapworld environment containing several rooms. \\ \tt Your task is to explore this world and reach an escape room.\\ \tt You are always given an image of the current room you are in. \\ \tt I have an image of the Escape Room, this is an initial description of my image - DESCRIPTION: The image shows a room decorated in a rustic, cabin-like style. The most prominent feature is a large, textured fireplace with a bear head mounted above it. To the left of the fireplace is a dark wooden wardrobe with a mirror on the wall above it. A bed with a colorful quilt dominates the foreground. There are two chairs, one with a red cushion, and a small table. The walls are designed to look like log cabin walls, and there are windows letting in light.\\ \tt \\ \tt Based on my description and the image given, you now have three options\\ \tt \\ \tt First Option - If you think that the description of my image matches the image you have, i.e.\\ \tt you are in the escape room then respond with one word - ESCAPE.\\ \tt \\ \tt Second Option - If you think you need more details from my image - respond in the following format\\ \tt QUESTION: Ask details about the image I have to verify if we have the same image or not\\ \tt \\ \tt Third Option - If you think you are in a different room than what I have, i.e we are seeing different images,\\ \tt then you can make a move in following Directions - ['west', 'south']. Respond in the following format\\ \tt MOVE: direction - Here direction can be one of {north, south, east, west}\\ \tt
