A dark wooden pool table dominates the foreground, with a purple felt surface. Behind the pool table is a light-colored sofa and a small coffee table. To the right of the sofa is a small side table with a lit candle. On the walls are several framed pictures, including a larger framed botanical print above the sofa.

The walls are a golden-yellow color. A dark wooden pool table dominates the foreground, with a purple felt surface. Behind the pool table is a light-colored sofa and a small coffee table. To the right of the sofa is a small side table with a lit candle. On the walls are several framed pictures, including a larger framed botanical print above the sofa.

Respond in the following format\\ \tt MOVE: direction - Here direction can be one of {north, south, east, west}\\ \tt
