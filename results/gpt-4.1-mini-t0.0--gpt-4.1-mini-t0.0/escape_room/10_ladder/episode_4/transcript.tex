	 DESCRIPTION: The ESCAPE ROOM is a dimly lit home theater with a large screen on the far wall displaying a sports event. There are four beige recliner chairs arranged in a single row facing the screen. The room has a carpeted floor in a warm brown tone and dark walls. Recessed ceiling lights provide soft illumination, and there are speakers embedded in the walls, suggesting a surround sound system. The overall atmosphere is cozy and designed for comfortable viewing.
