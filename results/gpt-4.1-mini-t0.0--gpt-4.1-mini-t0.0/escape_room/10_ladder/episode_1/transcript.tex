	 DESCRIPTION: The ESCAPE ROOM is a cozy home theater setup with dim lighting. It features a large screen on the wall displaying an image of a woman in traditional attire looking to the side. The room has several black acoustic panels on the walls, multiple speakers mounted around the screen, and a rack filled with CDs or DVDs. There are a few black chairs arranged facing the screen, creating a comfortable viewing area. The overall ambiance is warm and inviting, designed for an immersive movie-watching experience.
