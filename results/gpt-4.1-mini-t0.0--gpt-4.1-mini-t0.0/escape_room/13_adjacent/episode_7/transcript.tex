	 DESCRIPTION: The ESCAPE ROOM appears to be a well-lit, modern office waiting area. It features a light-colored carpet with a patterned rug in the center. There are several gray upholstered armchairs arranged around a small round table that holds a floral arrangement. To the left, there is a curved reception desk with another flower arrangement on top. The walls are light-colored, and one side has large glass panels or windows with beige curtains. The ceiling has recessed lighting panels, and there is a framed picture
