There is a curved wooden reception desk on the left where two people are standing. The space features prominent cylindrical wooden columns and wooden wall paneling. On the right side are dark wooden benches or seating areas with horizontal slat designs. The overall aesthetic is contemporary and professional with warm wood tones contrasting against the cool gray marble flooring.
