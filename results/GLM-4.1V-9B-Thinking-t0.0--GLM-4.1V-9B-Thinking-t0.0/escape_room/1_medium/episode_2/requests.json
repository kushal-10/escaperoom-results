The description of the ESCAPE ROOM is a soundproofed room with musical equipment (keyboards, synthesizers, audio processors), a person in a red hoodie adjusting equipment, acoustic panels, monitors, studio gear, carpeted floor, ceiling lights. The current room shown here is a kitchen area with a fridge, microwave, and chairs\u2014definitely not matching the ESCAPE ROOM's description. So the action should be moving in a direction. The options are west or east. Since the current room is not the ESCAPE ROOM, we need to move. Let's check the direction. The previous moves might have context, but the current room is a kitchen, so not the escape room. Therefore, move west or east? Wait, the options given for this step are ['west', 'east']. So we need to choose one. Let's pick west or east. But first, confirm the room is not the escape room. So the action is MOVE: west or east. Let's go with west. Wait, the image is the same as before, a kitchen. So definitely not the escape room. Therefore, move west.</think><answer><|begin_of_box|>MOVE: west<|end_of_box|></answer>",
