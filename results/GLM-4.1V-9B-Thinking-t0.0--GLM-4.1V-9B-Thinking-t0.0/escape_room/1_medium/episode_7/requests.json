The ESCAPE ROOM description says: \"an empty room with beige walls and white trim. the floor is carpeted in a brown/beige tone. there are white structural columns dividing the space. the ceiling has recessed lighting fixtures. a small window is visible in the back left corner, and there's a wooden door on the right side. the room appears spacious and minimally finished, with no furniture or decorations present. the overall lighting is soft and natural, with ceiling lights providing illumination.\"\n\nLooking at the current room image, it has wooden tables, chairs, lamps, and furniture. It's not empty, has furniture, and doesn't match the \"no furniture or decorations\" part. So it's definitely not the ESCAPE ROOM. The available directions are ['east', 'south'], so I need to choose a direction. Let's check the image again\u2014does it have the features of the ESCAPE ROOM? No, so move. Let's pick east or west? Wait, the options are ['east', 'south']. Let's see the image. The current room has tables, chairs, lamps\u2014so not the escape room. Therefore, move east or west? Wait, the options given are ['east', 'south'] for the third action. Wait, the action 3 says \"choose a direction from the available options: ['east', 'south']\". So I need to pick one. Let's check the image again. The room has wooden furniture, so not the escape room. Therefore, move east or west? Wait, the previous moves had west, east, etc. But the current options are east or south. Let's pick east. Wait, no\u2014wait, the image shows a room with tables and chairs, so definitely not the escape room. So move east. Wait, but let me confirm. The ESCAPE ROOM is empty, has no furniture, beige walls, white trim, carpeted floor, structural columns, etc. This room has furniture, so not the escape room. Therefore, move east. Wait, but the options are ['east', 'south']. So the action is MOVE: east. Wait, but let me check again. The image shows a room with wooden tables, chairs, lamps, and a clock. The ESCAPE ROOM has no furniture, so this is not it. Therefore, move east.</think><answer>MOVE: east\n</answer>",

The ESCAPE ROOM description says: \"an empty room with beige walls and white trim. the floor is carpeted in a brown/beige tone. there are white structural columns dividing the space. the ceiling has recessed lighting fixtures. a small window is visible in the back left corner, and there's a wooden door on the right side. the room appears spacious and minimally finished, with no furniture or decorations present. the overall lighting is soft and natural, with ceiling lights providing illumination.\"\n\nLooking at the current room image, it has wooden tables, chairs, lamps, and a clock on the wall. It's furnished with furniture, which doesn't match the \"no furniture or decorations\" part of the ESCAPE ROOM description. So the current room is definitely not the ESCAPE ROOM. The available directions are ['west', 'east'], so I need to choose a direction. Let's check the options. The action should be MOVE with a direction. Since the current room doesn't match, I'll choose a direction. Let's pick east or west. Let's go with east for now, but need to check. Wait, the image shows a room with tables and chairs, so it's not the empty one. Therefore, the action is MOVE with a direction. Let's choose east.</think><answer>MOVE: east\n</answer>",
