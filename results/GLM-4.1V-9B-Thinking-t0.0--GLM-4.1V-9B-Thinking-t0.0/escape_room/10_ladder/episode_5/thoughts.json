The description of the ESCAPE ROOM is a hotel room with two double beds, patterned bedspreads, white pillows, floral curtains, a large window with stone building view, small round table, chairs, bedside lamps, light-colored walls, carpeted floor. \n\nLooking at the current image: there are two beds with patterned bedspreads (matches), but let's check other elements. The room has two beds with floral-patterned bedspreads, bedside lamps (matches), but does it have the floral curtains, large window with stone building, small round table? The current image doesn't show curtains or a window with stone building view. The walls are light-colored, carpeted floor (matches). But the key elements like floral curtains, large window with stone view, small round table with chairs aren't visible here. Wait, the current room has two beds, but the description mentions \"two double beds covered in patterned bedspreads, white pillows\" \u2013 do the pillows look white? The pillows in the current image seem to have patterns, not white. Also, the curtains in the description are floral, but this room has no visible curtains. The current room has a nightstand with lamps, but no small round table with chairs. So this room doesn't match the ESCAPE ROOM description. Therefore, I need to choose a direction. The available directions are ['west', 'east', 'south']. Let's check the current room's features again. The current room has musical equipment (drums, speakers) which the ESCAPE ROOM doesn't have. So definitely not the ESCAPE ROOM. Therefore, I should move. Let's pick a direction, say west or east or south. Let's choose west.</think><answer>MOVE: west\n</answer>",
