Wait, the previous moves were west, east, etc., but the current image is the same as before? Wait, no, the image is the hotel room again. So since it's not the escape room, we need to move. But let's confirm. The escape room has armchairs, bookshelf, windows, plants, carpet, etc. This room has beds, nightstand, phone, which are not in the escape room description. So definitely not the escape room. Therefore, choose a direction. Let's pick west or east, but need to follow the format. Wait, the action is to move, so let's say west. But let's check the image again. The current room is a hotel room with two beds, which is not the escape room. So the action is MOVE: west (or any direction, but need to follow the rules).</think><answer>MOVE: west\n</answer>",
