The room has rows of brown reclining chairs, carpeted flooring (the colorful rug), but does it have the large screen with clownfish? The image shows chairs but no visible screen with the clownfish. Also, the lighting doesn't seem dimly lit with blue/purple ambient lighting. The walls don't have paneling (they look plain white), and the ceiling isn't dark with recessed lighting. So this room doesn't match the ESCAPE ROOM description. The available directions are north and east. So I need to move in one of those directions. Let's check the current image again. The chairs are reclining, carpeted, but the screen and lighting don't match. So I should move. Let's choose north or east. Let's say north. Wait, the options are ['north', 'east'] for moving if not the escape room.
