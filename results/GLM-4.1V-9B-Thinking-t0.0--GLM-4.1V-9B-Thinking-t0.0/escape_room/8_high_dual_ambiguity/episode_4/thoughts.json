The description of the ESCAPE ROOM mentions rows of black theater seats, a large white projection screen, warm orange/brown walls, framed posters, recessed lighting, projector, checkered carpet, glass doors, etc. The current image shows what looks like a theater with seating, a large screen, but let's check the details. The room here has a different setup\u2014maybe the seating arrangement, walls, and other features don't match. Wait, the ESCAPE ROOM has black theater seats in rows, but this image has more modern seating, maybe not rows of black seats. Also, the walls don't look warm orange/brown, the carpet is different. So this room doesn't match the ESCAPE ROOM description. Therefore, I need to move in one of the directions. But the options are west or east. Wait, the current room doesn't match, so I should move. But which direction? Wait, the problem says \"choose a direction from the available options: ['west', 'east']\" but I need to pick one. Wait, but maybe I should check if I can move. Since the current room isn't the escape room, I need to move. Let me think about the image again. The current room has a large screen but the seating isn't the same as described. So I'll choose a direction, say west or east. Let's pick west.</think><answer>MOVE: west</answer>",
