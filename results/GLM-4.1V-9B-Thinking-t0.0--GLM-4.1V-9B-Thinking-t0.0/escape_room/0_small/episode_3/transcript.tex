	 DESCRIPTION: This is a modern bathroom with a minimalist design. The room features a white toilet positioned centrally, with a small silver trash can next to it. There's a glass-enclosed shower area with a showerhead and controls visible in the back corner. The walls and floor are covered in light beige tiles, creating a clean, bright atmosphere. A towel rack with a white towel is visible on the left side, and part of what appears to be a sink is visible on the right edge of the image. The bathroom has recessed ceiling lighting that illuminates the space evenly. The overall design is sleek and contemporary with neutral color tones.
