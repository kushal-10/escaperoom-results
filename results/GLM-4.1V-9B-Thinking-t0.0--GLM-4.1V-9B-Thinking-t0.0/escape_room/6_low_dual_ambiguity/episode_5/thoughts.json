The beds have dark red/maroon headboards with gold trim. Between the beds is a nightstand with a lamp that has a white shade. On the nightstand, there appears to be a telephone, some remote controls, and what looks like a small notepad or information card.\n\nAbove the beds, there's a framed artwork or painting on the wall.

The lighting in the room is warm, primarily from the lamp between the beds.\n\nThis is clearly a hotel room or guest room setting, not an escape room.
