The current room here is a basement-like room with stairs, a pink-covered appliance, and plain walls\u2014no reception elements. So it's definitely not the ESCAPE ROOM. The available directions are west and east. Since the previous moves were west/east, but need to choose a direction. Let's pick west or east? Wait, the options are ['west', 'east']. Let's check the room again. The current room doesn't match, so move. Let's choose west or east? Wait, the image is the same as before, so move west or east. Let's do MOVE: west. Wait, but need to check the action. The action is to move if not the room. So the current room is not the ESCAPE ROOM, so choose direction. Let's pick west.</think><answer>MOVE: west\n</answer>",

The description of the ESCAPE ROOM is a reception area with a wooden counter, sign \"the university of vermont\", framed tower picture, desk lamp, computer monitor, light-colored walls, wooden paneling. The current image is a classroom with sewing machines, which doesn't match the ESCAPE ROOM description. So the current room is definitely not the ESCAPE ROOM. The available directions are ['east', 'south'], so I need to choose a direction. Let's pick east or south? Wait, the options are ['east', 'south'], so let's choose one. Let's go with east. Wait, no, the previous moves were east or west, but now the options are east and south. Wait, the action is to choose direction from ['east', 'south'] if not the ESCAPE ROOM. So the current room is not the ESCAPE ROOM, so move. Let's do MOVE: east. Wait, but let's check the image again. The current image is a classroom with kids and sewing machines, which is not the reception area. So the action is MOVE: east (or south, but let's pick east).</think><answer>MOVE: east\n</answer>",
