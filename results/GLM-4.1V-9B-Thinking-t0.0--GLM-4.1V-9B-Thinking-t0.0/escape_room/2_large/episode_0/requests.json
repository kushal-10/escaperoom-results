The description of the ESCAPE ROOM is a walk-in closet/storage room with wooden cabinetry, multiple shelves with boxes/baskets, hanging garments on both sides, a bench near a large arched window, and green carpeted floor. The current room image doesn't match that description. It seems like a different type of room, maybe a bedroom or something else. So since it's definitely not the ESCAPE ROOM, I need to choose a direction. The options are east or south. Let's check the image again. The current room doesn't have the wooden cabinetry, shelves, hanging garments, bench, or green carpet. So I'll move east.</think><answer>MOVE: east\n</answer>",
