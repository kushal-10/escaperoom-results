The description of the ESCAPE ROOM is a reception area with a curved wooden desk, person at desk, light green walls, patterned sofa, wooden coffee table, floor lamp, potted plants. The current room here shows a reception area with a curved wooden desk, a person at the desk, light-colored walls (though not light green, but maybe similar), and the setting. Wait, let's check the details. The current room has a reception desk, a person standing at the desk, which matches the description. The walls are light, the desk is curved wooden, there's a person at the desk. So does this match the ESCAPE ROOM description? Let's check the elements: reception area, curved wooden desk, person at desk, walls (though color might differ, but the key elements like desk, person, reception area). Wait, the original description says light green walls, but this room has white walls. Hmm, but maybe the key elements are there. Wait, the question is if it exactly matches. Let's check again. The ESCAPE ROOM description has: curved wooden desk, person standing at the desk, light green walls, patterned sofa, wooden coffee table, floor lamp, potted plants. The current room has a curved wooden desk, a person at the desk, but does it have the other elements? The current room has a reception area, but the sofa, coffee table, floor lamp, potted plants\u2014do we see those? The image shows a reception desk with a person, but the other elements like sofa, coffee table, floor lamp, potted plants aren't visible. So maybe it's not exactly matching. Wait, but let's check the options. The action choices are ESCAPE, QUESTION, MOVE. If it's not exactly matching, then we need to check if it's similar or not. But the current room doesn't have the sofa, coffee table, floor lamp, potted plants. So it's definitely not the ESCAPE ROOM. Wait, but the direction options are west and east. Wait, the previous moves might have changed the direction options. Wait, the current direction options are ['west', 'east']? Wait, the user said \"choose a direction from the available options: ['west', 'east']\" for action 3. So if the current room is not the ESCAPE ROOM, then move west or east. But let's check the image again. The image shows a reception area with a curved wooden desk, a person at the desk, but the walls are white, not light green. The other elements like sofa, coffee table, floor lamp, potted plants are not present. So the current room doesn't match the ESCAPE ROOM description. Therefore, the action should be MOVE: west or east. Wait, let's confirm. The ESCAPE ROOM has specific elements: curved wooden desk, person at desk, light green walls, patterned sofa, wooden coffee table, floor lamp, potted plants. The current room has a curved wooden desk, person at desk, but lacks the sofa, coffee table, floor lamp, potted plants, and walls are not light green. So it's definitely not the ESCAPE ROOM. Therefore, choose a direction. Let's pick west. So the response would be MOVE: west.</think><answer>MOVE: west\n</answer>",

The description of the ESCAPE ROOM is a reception area with a curved wooden desk, person at desk, light green walls, patterned sofa, wooden coffee table, floor lamp, potted plants. The current room here is a reception area with a curved wooden desk, a person at the desk, light-colored walls (though not light green), patterned sofa area? Wait, let's check the details. The current room has a reception desk with a person, similar layout. But let's check if it matches exactly. The ESCAPE ROOM description has light green walls, but this room has white walls. Also, the furniture: the current room has a reception desk, person, but the walls are white, not light green. Wait, the question is if it exactly matches. The current room's image shows a reception area with a curved wooden desk, person at desk, which matches the first part. But the walls are white, not light green. Also, the other elements: patterned sofa, wooden coffee table, floor lamp, potted plants\u2014do we see those? The image shows a reception area with a desk, person, but the sofa area might not be visible. Wait, the ESCAPE ROOM has light green walls, patterned sofa, wooden coffee table, floor lamp, potted plants. The current room's walls are white, not light green. So it's not exactly matching. Wait, but let's check the options. The action choices are ESCAPE, QUESTION, MOVE. If it's not exactly matching, then we need to check if it's similar or not. But the current room doesn't have the light green walls, patterned sofa (maybe), etc. So it's definitely not the ESCAPE ROOM. Wait, but the direction options are west and east. Wait, the previous moves might have changed directions, but now the current room is a reception area, but not matching the description. So the action would be MOVE: west or east. Wait, let's check the image again. The current room is a reception area with a curved wooden desk, person at desk, but the walls are white, not light green. The ESCAPE ROOM has light green walls. So the current room is not the ESCAPE ROOM. Therefore, choose a direction. But the options are west and east. Wait, the question is what action to choose. Let's confirm: if the room doesn't match, then move. So the action would be MOVE: west or east. But which one? Wait, the image shows a reception area, but the direction options are west and east. Let's pick one. But the format requires choosing direction. So the answer would be MOVE: west (or east, either is fine as long as it's one of the options). Wait, but let's check again. The ESCAPE ROOM has light green walls, patterned sofa, wooden coffee table, floor lamp, potted plants. The current room has a reception desk, person, but no floor lamp, no potted plants, walls are white. So definitely not the ESCAPE ROOM. Therefore, move. So the action is MOVE: west (or east).</think><answer>MOVE: west\n</answer>",

The current room here is a reception area with a wooden desk, a person at the desk, white walls, tiled floor, and a wooden counter. Let's check if it matches. The ESCAPE ROOM has light green walls, but this room has white walls. Also, the furniture and layout might differ. Wait, the current room is a reception area with a wooden counter, but the ESCAPE ROOM description has a curved wooden desk, light green walls, etc. This room doesn't have light green walls, patterned sofa, floor lamp, potted plants. So it's not the ESCAPE ROOM. The options are west or east. Let's check the direction. The question says choose direction from ['west', 'east']. So need to move. But first, confirm if it's not the escape room. So move west or east. Let's see the image again. The room has a reception counter, white walls, tiled floor. The ESCAPE ROOM has light green walls, so this is not it. Therefore, move west or east. Let's choose west. Wait, the action is to move if not the escape room. So reply with MOVE: west or east. Let's check the options. The current room is not the escape room, so choose direction. Let's go with west.</think><answer>MOVE: west\n</answer>",
