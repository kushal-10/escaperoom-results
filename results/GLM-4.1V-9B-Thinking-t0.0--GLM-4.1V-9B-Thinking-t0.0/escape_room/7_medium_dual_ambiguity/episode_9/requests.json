Wait, the current image is a recording studio with the person, but does it match the ESCAPE ROOM description? Let's check the description again. The ESCAPE ROOM has \"professional audio equipment including multiple monitors, a keyboard/piano, audio mixers, and speakers. there's a drum set in the corner, and two electric guitars hang on the wall. the room has beige walls, a black leather chair, and a potted plant. large windows provide natural light and show buildings outside. the space is organized with various audio equipment arranged around a central workstation.\" The current room image shows audio equipment (mixer, monitors, speakers) but no drum set, guitars, beige walls, black leather chair, potted plant, large windows. So this room doesn't match the ESCAPE ROOM description. Therefore, I need to move. The available directions are ['east', 'south'], so I can choose either. But let's check the previous moves. Wait, the current image is the same as the first one? Wait, no, the user is moving through rooms. Wait, the current image is a recording studio, but it doesn't have the elements of the ESCAPE ROOM. So I should move. Let's choose east or south. Let's say MOVE: east. Wait, but let me confirm. The current room is not the ESCAPE ROOM, so I need to move. The action should be MOVE with a direction.</think><answer>MOVE: east\n</answer>",

The description of the ESCAPE ROOM is a music production studio with specific elements: professional audio equipment (monitors, keyboard/piano, mixers, speakers), drum set, electric guitars, beige walls, black leather chair, potted plant, large windows with buildings outside, organized with audio equipment around a central workstation.\n\nLooking at the current room image, it seems to have audio equipment (mixer, speakers, racks), but let's check if it matches. The image shows a control room with audio equipment, but does it have the specific elements like the drum set, electric guitars, beige walls, black leather chair, potted plant, large windows? The current image doesn't show those elements clearly. Wait, the previous images had different setups, but now let's check if this room matches. If it doesn't match, then I need to move. But wait, the action options are 'east' or 'south' if not matching. Wait, the current room doesn't seem to have the specific features of the ESCAPE ROOM. So I should choose a direction. But let me check again. The ESCAPE ROOM has specific items: drum set, electric guitars, beige walls, black leather chair, potted plant, large windows. The current room image doesn't show those. So it's definitely not the ESCAPE ROOM, so I need to move. The options are 'east' or 'south'. Let's pick one. But the format says if not matching, choose direction from ['east', 'south']. So I'll choose east or south. Let's say east. Wait, but the previous moves were east, west, etc. But the current action is to move. So the response should be MOVE: east or MOVE: south. Let's check the image again. The current room has audio equipment but lacks the specific elements. So I'll choose a direction. Let's go with east.</think><answer>MOVE: east</answer>",

So the current room is definitely not the ESCAPE ROOM. The available directions are ['west', 'east']. So I need to choose a direction. Let's check the image again. The room has a closet with clothes, which is not part of the music studio description. So the room is not the escape room. Therefore, I should move. Let's pick a direction, say east or west. Let's choose east. Wait, the action is to move, so reply with MOVE: east or west. Let's confirm. The current room has a closet with clothes, which is not in the ESCAPE ROOM description. So it's not the escape room. Therefore, move. Let's say MOVE: east.</think><answer>MOVE: east</answer>",
