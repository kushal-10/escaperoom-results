The description of the ESCAPE ROOM mentions a spacious walk-in closet with large glass sliding doors, colorful clothing on racks, suitcases, storage boxes, shoes, ornate rug, chandelier, warm neutral walls, vanity area, etc. The current image shows a clothing rack with various garments, but let's check if it matches. Wait, the current room has clothing on hangers, but does it have the other elements like glass doors, suitcases, chandelier, etc.? The image shows a clothing rack with various clothes, but maybe it's not the exact match yet. Wait, let's check the description again. The ESCAPE ROOM has large glass sliding doors, which this image doesn't show. Also, the current room doesn't have the chandelier, suitcases, storage boxes, shoes, ornate rug, vanity area, etc. So this room is not the ESCAPE ROOM. But wait, the options for direction are 'south' and 'west' now. Wait, the previous move was north, now the current room is not the escape room, so need to move. But let me check the image again. The current image shows a clothing rack with various garments, but maybe it's a closet, but not the described one. So since it's not the escape room, I need to move. But which direction? Wait, the options are 'south' and 'west'. But maybe I need to check if I can move. Wait, the action is to choose direction if not escape. So the current room is not the escape room, so I need to move. But let's think: the current room has clothing, but not the full features of the escape room. So I should move. But which direction? Wait, the problem says \"choose a direction from the available options: ['south', 'west']\" (wait, in the second prompt, the options were ['south', 'west']? Wait, original first prompt had ['east', 'north'], then second prompt has ['south', 'west']. So now, the current room is not the escape room, so I need to move. But let's check the image again. The current image shows a clothing rack with various clothes, but maybe it's a closet, but not the one described. So I need to move. But which direction? Wait, maybe I should move west or south. But let's think: the escape room has large glass sliding doors, which this image doesn't have. So this is not the escape room. Therefore, I need to move. Let's choose west or south. Wait, the image shows a clothing rack, maybe the direction to move is west? Wait, no, let's check the rules again. The action is to choose direction if not escape. So the current room is not the escape room, so I need to move. Let's say I move west. Wait, but let me check the image again. The current room has clothing, but the escape room has more elements. So the current room is not the escape room, so I need to move. Therefore, the action is MOVE: west (or south, but need to pick one). Wait, let's check the image again. The current image shows a clothing rack with various garments, but no glass doors, no chandelier, no suitcases, etc. So it's not the escape room. Therefore, I need to move. Let's choose west. Wait, but maybe the correct direction is west. So the response would be MOVE: west. Wait, but let me confirm. The current room is not the escape room, so I need to move. Therefore, the action is MOVE: west (or south, but need to pick one). Let's go with west.</think><answer>MOVE: west</answer>",
