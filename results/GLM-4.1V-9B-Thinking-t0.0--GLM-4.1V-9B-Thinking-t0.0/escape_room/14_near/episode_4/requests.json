The description of the ESCAPE ROOM is a home theater with sloped ceiling, dark walls, warm beige carpet, five beige reclining chairs, large projection screen, projector, cabinets on the right, cozy dimly-lit atmosphere. The current room shown is an art studio with paintings, easel, artist, which doesn't match the home theater description. So the current room is definitely not the ESCAPE ROOM. The available directions are west and east. I need to choose a direction. Let's check the options. The action should be MOVE with a direction. Since the current room is not the escape room, I'll choose a direction. Let's pick east or west. Let's go with east.</think><answer><|begin_of_box|>MOVE: east<|end_of_box|></answer>",
