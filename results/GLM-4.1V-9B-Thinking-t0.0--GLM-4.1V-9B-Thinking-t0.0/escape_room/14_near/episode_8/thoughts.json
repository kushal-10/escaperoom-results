The description of the ESCAPE ROOM is a reception area with a curved wooden desk, person at desk, light green walls, patterned sofa, wooden coffee table, floor lamp, potted plants. The current image shows a reception area with a curved wooden desk (the bar area), a person standing at the desk (the staff), light-colored walls (white), tiled floor, plants, and furniture. Wait, does this match? Let's check each element. The current room has a curved wooden desk (reception desk), a person at the desk, light walls (though not light green, but maybe the description's light green is similar in tone), potted plants, and what seems like a reception area. Wait, the description says \"light green walls\" but the current image has white walls. Hmm, but let's check if it's the ESCAPE ROOM. The image shows a reception area with a curved wooden desk, a person at the desk, plants, and the overall setup. The description matches the reception area type. So does this current room match the ESCAPE ROOM description? Let's check all elements: curved wooden desk (yes, the reception desk), person standing at desk (yes, the staff), light green walls? Wait, the current image has white walls, but maybe the description's \"light green\" is a general term. Also, the other elements: patterned sofa, wooden coffee table, floor lamp, potted plants. The current image doesn't show a sofa, coffee table, floor lamp, but does show plants. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Wait, the current image shows a reception area with a curved wooden desk, a person, plants, tiled floor, and white walls. The ESCAPE ROOM description has light green walls, patterned sofa, etc. Since the current room doesn't have those specific elements (sofa, coffee table, floor lamp), but the question is if it exactly matches. If it doesn't have all the elements, then it's not the ESCAPE ROOM. Wait, no\u2014wait, the current image might be the ESCAPE ROOM. Wait, let's check again. The ESCAPE ROOM description: reception area, curved wooden desk, person at desk, light green walls, patterned sofa, wooden coffee table, floor lamp, potted plants. The current image shows a reception area with a curved wooden desk (the bar), a person at the desk, plants (potted plants), but the walls are white, not light green. Also, no sofa, coffee table, floor lamp. So this room doesn't match all the elements. Therefore, it's not the ESCAPE ROOM, so I need to move. But wait, the options are west or east. Wait, the previous move was west, now I'm in a new room. Wait, the current image is a reception area with a curved wooden desk, person, plants, white walls. Since it doesn't match the description (light green walls, sofa, coffee table, floor lamp), then I should move. But which direction? Wait, the action is to choose direction. But maybe I need to check again. Wait, the description says \"light green walls\"\u2014the current image has white walls, so not matching. Therefore, the current room is not the ESCAPE ROOM, so I need to move. But the options are west or east. Wait, but maybe I made a mistake. Wait, let's check the image again. The image shows a reception area with a curved wooden desk (the bar), a person standing at the desk, plants, tiled floor, white walls. The ESCAPE ROOM has light green walls, patterned sofa, wooden coffee table, floor lamp. Since the current room doesn't have those elements, it's not the ESCAPE ROOM. Therefore, I should move. But which direction? Wait, the problem says \"choose a direction from the available options: ['west', 'east']\" but I don't know the available directions. Wait, maybe the previous room had directions, but now I need to move. Wait, the action is to choose direction. But since I don't know the available directions, maybe the standard is to move west or east. Wait, but the image might have exits. Wait, the current image shows a room with a door? Wait, the image shows a reception area with a door on the left? Wait, no, the image shows a room with a curved desk, a person, plants, and the room has exits? Wait, maybe the available directions are west or east. Since the current room doesn't match, I need to move. Let's say I move west. Wait, but the format requires \"MOVE: chosen direction\". So the answer would be MOVE: west or MOVE: east. But let's think again. The current room has pink and blue walls, which don't match the ESCAPE ROOM's light green walls, curved desk, etc. So it's not the ESCAPE ROOM, so move. Let's choose west.</think><answer>MOVE: west</answer>",

The ESCAPE ROOM has light green walls, patterned sofa, wooden coffee table, floor lamp, potted plants. The current image has white walls, tiled floor, no sofa, no coffee table, no floor lamp. So this is definitely not the ESCAPE ROOM. So I need to choose a direction. The options are ['west', 'east']. But wait, the previous moves might have context, but the current image is the one. So since it's not the ESCAPE ROOM, I need to move. But which direction? Wait, the options are west or east. But maybe I need to check. Wait, the current image is a reception area with white walls, tiled floor, plants, but no sofa, no coffee table. So not matching. Therefore, I should move. But which direction? Wait, the problem says \"choose a direction from the available options: ['west', 'east']\" but the image doesn't show directions. Wait, maybe the previous moves had directions, but now the current image is the one. Wait, the image is the same as before? Wait, no, the user provided a new image. Wait, let me check again. The current image is a reception area with a curved wooden desk, person, plants, white walls, tiled floor. The ESCAPE ROOM has light green walls, patterned sofa, etc. So this is not the ESCAPE ROOM. Therefore, I need to move. But which direction? The options are west or east. Since the image doesn't show directions, maybe the previous moves had context, but now I need to choose. Wait, the problem says \"choose a direction from the available options: ['west', 'east']\" so I need to pick one. But maybe the image has exits. Wait, the image shows a reception area with a door behind the desk? No, the image shows a desk with a person, and the room has chairs and plants. So maybe the direction is east or west. But since the image doesn't show clear directions, maybe the answer is to move west or east. But let's think: the current room is not the ESCAPE ROOM, so I need to move. Let's say move west. Wait, but the previous moves had west, east, etc. But the current image is the same as before? Wait, no, the user provided a new image. Wait, the image is a reception area with a curved wooden desk, person, plants, white walls. So not matching the ESCAPE ROOM's description. Therefore, I need to move.

The description of the ESCAPE ROOM is a reception area with a curved wooden desk, person at desk, light green walls, patterned sofa, wooden coffee table, floor lamp, potted plants.

The available directions are east and south. Since the current room is not the ESCAPE ROOM, I need to choose a direction. Let's check the options. The action should be MOVE with a direction.

The description of the ESCAPE ROOM is a reception area with a curved wooden desk, person at desk, light green walls, patterned sofa, wooden coffee table, floor lamp, potted plants. The current image shows a reception area with a curved wooden desk, a person at the desk, white walls, tiled floor, plants, etc. Wait, the current room matches the description? Wait, let's check. The image has a reception desk, a person, plants, the architectural style. Wait, the description says \"light green walls\" but the current image has white walls. Wait, no, maybe I made a mistake. Wait, the current image is a reception area with a curved wooden desk, person at desk, which matches the first part. But the walls in the description are light green, while the current image has white walls. Wait, but maybe the current room is the ESCAPE ROOM? Wait, let's check the description again. The ESCAPE ROOM has light green walls, patterned sofa, wooden coffee table, floor lamp, potted plants. The current image has a reception area with a desk, person, plants, but walls are white. Hmm, maybe the current room is not exactly matching. Wait, but the image shows a reception area with a curved wooden desk, person, which is part of the description. Wait, maybe I need to check if it's exactly matching. The description says \"reception area with a curved wooden desk, a person standing at the desk, light green walls, a patterned sofa, a wooden coffee table, a floor lamp, and some potted plants\". The current image has a curved wooden desk, person at desk, but walls are white, no sofa, coffee table, floor lamp. So maybe it's not exactly matching. Wait, but the previous images were colorful rooms, now this is a reception area. Wait, let's check the current image again. The image shows a reception area with a curved wooden desk, a person standing at the desk, white walls, tiled floor, plants. The description has light green walls, which don't match. So the current room is not the ESCAPE ROOM. Therefore, I need to choose a direction. The options are ['west', 'east']. Let's see the previous moves, but now the action is to move. Wait, the current image is the reception area, but does it match? If not, move. So the action would be MOVE: west or east. But let's check the image again. The image has a reception desk, person, plants, but the walls are white, not light green. So it's not the ESCAPE ROOM. Therefore, choose a direction. Let's say MOVE: west. Wait, but the options are ['west', 'east']. Let me confirm. The current room is not the ESCAPE ROOM, so move. So the action is MOVE: west.</think><answer>MOVE: west</answer>",
