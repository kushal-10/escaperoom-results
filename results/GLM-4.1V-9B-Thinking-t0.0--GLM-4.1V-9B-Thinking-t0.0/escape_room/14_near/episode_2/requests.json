The escape room has white cabinets, dining table, window with greenery. Current room has light brown cabinets, no dining table, no window with greenery. So definitely not. Therefore, move. But which direction? The options are 'west' or 'east'. Let's pick one. But the format is to choose direction. So the action would be MOVE: west or east. But let's check the image again.
