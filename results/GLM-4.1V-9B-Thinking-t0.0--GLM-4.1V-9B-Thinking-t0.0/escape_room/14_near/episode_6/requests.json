The current room image doesn't match that description at all. It looks like a locker room or storage area with lockers, checkered floor, and no reading room elements. So the current room is definitely not the ESCAPE ROOM. The available directions are east and south. I need to choose a direction. Let's check the image again. The room has lockers, so it's not the reading room. Therefore, I should move in one of the directions. Let's pick east or south. Wait, the options are ['east', 'south']. Let's choose east. Wait, no, let me check the image again. Wait, the current room image shows a locker area with checkered floor, lockers, and no reading room elements. So the current room is not the ESCAPE ROOM, so I need to move. Let's choose east. Wait, the action should be MOVE: east or south. Let's confirm. The current room is definitely not the ESCAPE ROOM, so I'll choose a direction. Let's go with east.</think><answer>MOVE: east</answer>",
