	 DESCRIPTION: This is a home theater or escape room with beige walls and warm lighting. There's a large screen on the right wall displaying a scene with a person in traditional clothing. The room has several black chairs arranged facing the screen. On the left wall, there are black sound-absorbing panels and wall-mounted lights. A tall black speaker is mounted on the left wall, and there's a media rack with DVDs/Blu-rays in the center. Several black speakers are positioned around the room. The space is designed for immersive viewing with dim lighting and acoustic treatments.
