So the current room is the reception area, which is not the escape room. So the action is MOVE with a direction. Let's choose south. Wait, but the options are ['north', 'east']. So I need to pick one. Let's say MOVE: south. Wait, no, the options are ['north', 'east'], so maybe I should pick north? Wait, no, the current room is the same as before.
