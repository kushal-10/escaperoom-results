So, the ESCAPE ROOM's image has a wooden reception desk, people at the counter, wooden walls, maybe a mirror or reflection, and the overall setting. Let's structure the description.\n\nFirst, observe the elements: the room has wooden paneling, a reception counter with a light wood top, people (one person in a white shirt at the counter, another in a dark shirt interacting), a mirror or reflective surface showing another person, and the walls are wooden with some signs or posters. The lighting is warm, with ceiling lights.
