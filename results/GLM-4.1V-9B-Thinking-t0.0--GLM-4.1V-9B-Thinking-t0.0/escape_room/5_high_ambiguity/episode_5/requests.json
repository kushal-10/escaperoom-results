The beds have dark red/maroon headboards with gold trim. Between the beds is a nightstand with a lamp that has a white shade. On the nightstand, there appears to be a telephone, some remote controls, and what looks like a small notepad or information card.\n\nAbove the beds, there's a framed artwork or painting on the wall.

The lighting in the room is warm, primarily from the lamp between the beds.\n\nThis is clearly a hotel room or guest room setting, not an escape room.

The description of the ESCAPE ROOM is a hotel room with two beds, floral bedspreads, headboards, nightstand, lamp, artwork, etc. The current room shown is a computer lab with multiple monitors, keyboards, desks\u2014this doesn't match the hotel room description at all. So the current room is definitely not the ESCAPE ROOM. The available directions are ['west', 'east'], so I need to choose a direction. But wait, the previous moves were west, east, etc., but now the current room is a computer lab, so I should move. Let me check the options. The action is to move west or east. Since the current room is not the escape room, I need to move. Let's pick west or east. Wait, the image is the same as before? Wait, no, the user provided the same image as before? Wait, no, let me check. Wait, the current image is the computer lab again? Wait, no, the user's image is the same as the previous one. Wait, no, the current image is the computer lab, so it's not the escape room. So I need to move. Let's choose west. Wait, but the options are ['west', 'east']. So the action is MOVE: west or east. Let's pick west.</think><answer>MOVE: west\n</answer>",

Each room is shown to you as an image.\n\nYour objective is to navigate this environment and reach the ESCAPE ROOM.\n\nThere can be multiple rooms of the same type (e.g., a MapWorld with 4 rooms may contain 2 visually similar bathrooms).\nThese rooms might look nearly identical, but not exactly the same.\n\nI only have the image of the ESCAPE ROOM and will describe it to you. I do not know what room you are in, or how your\nroom's image looks like.\n\nAt each step, you will be shown an image of your current room.\n\nYou may perform only one of the following actions:\n\n1. If the current room exactly matches the ESCAPE ROOM based on my description, respond strictly with -\nESCAPE\n\n2. If the current room seems similar to the ESCAPE ROOM but you are uncertain, ask me a clarifying question that focuses on visually distinguishing\nfeatures that can help you tell your current room apart from the ESCAPE ROOM described.\nRespond strictly with -\nQUESTION: your question\n\n3. If the current room is definitely not the ESCAPE ROOM, choose a direction from the available options: ['west', 'east']\nreply strictly with -\nMOVE: chosen direction\n\nHere is the description of the ESCAPE ROOM:\ndescription: this appears to be a hotel room with two beds. each bed has floral-patterned bedspreads in earth tones with green, yellow, and brown patterns. the beds have dark red/maroon headboards with gold trim. between the beds is a nightstand with a lamp that has a white shade, casting a warm glow. on the nightstand, there are various items including what appears to be a telephone, remote controls, and some papers. above the beds hangs a framed artwork depicting what looks like an abstract design with a fan-like shape and decorative elements. the walls are painted in neutral beige tones, and there appears to be some clothing or items on the left bed. the overall lighting is warm and cozy\nWhat action do you choose?\n\nYou must follow the above format rules exactly.\nDo not respond in any other format.

The description of the ESCAPE ROOM is a hotel room with two beds, floral bedspreads, headboards, nightstand, lamp, etc. The current room shown here has musical equipment like drums, speakers, microphones\u2014this is definitely not a hotel room with beds. So the current room is not the ESCAPE ROOM. The options for direction are ['west', 'east'], so I need to choose a direction. Let's check the previous moves, but the action is to move. Since the room is not the escape room, I should move. Let's pick east or west. Wait, the options are ['west', 'east'], so let's choose one. Let's say east. Wait, but need to check the image. The current image is the music room, so not the escape room. Therefore, move.</think><answer><|begin_of_box|>MOVE: east<|end_of_box|></answer>",
