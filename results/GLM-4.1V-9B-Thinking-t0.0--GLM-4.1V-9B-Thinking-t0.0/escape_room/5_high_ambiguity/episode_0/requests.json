Wait, the image shows a bench, but let's check details). Wait, the current room has wooden cabinetry, shelves with boxes/baskets (the shoe rack, cabinets, etc.), hanging garments on both sides. But does it have a large arched window? The image doesn't show a window, maybe. Also, the carpet\u2014does it have a green carpet? The current room's floor is wooden, not carpeted. Wait, the description says green carpeted floor. The current room has a rug, but not green. Also, the bench near a large arched window\u2014does the current room have that?

Wait, the current room is a closet, but not matching. So the action is MOVE: west (or east, but need to pick).

Wait, the previous moves might have context, but the current image is the closet. Since it's not the escape room, move. Let's pick a direction, say west. But need to follow the format.</think><answer>MOVE: west\n</answer>",
            "response": "MOVE: west"
