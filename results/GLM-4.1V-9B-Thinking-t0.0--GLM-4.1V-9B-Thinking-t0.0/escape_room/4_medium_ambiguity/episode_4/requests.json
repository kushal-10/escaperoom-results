The current room is a hotel room with beds and typical hotel furniture, while the ESCAPE ROOM is described as a home theater/movie room with reclining chairs facing a screen.

The ceiling is not dark with recessed lighting, and there's no blue/purple ambient lighting.\n\nSince this is not the ESCAPE ROOM, I need to choose a direction from 'west' or 'east' to move.
