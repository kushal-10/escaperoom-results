The description of the ESCAPE ROOM is a professional reception area with a curved wooden desk, \"levencrown\" and \"panalytik law counsel\" on the wall, beige walls and carpeting, wooden door on the right, vase with flowers, clean corporate appearance. The current room here is an office with a desk, bookshelf, photos on the wall, which doesn't match the reception area description. So it's definitely not the ESCAPE ROOM. The available directions are east and south, so I need to choose one. Let's pick east or west? Wait, the options are ['east', 'south']? Wait, the previous moves had west/east/south, but now the options are east, south. Wait, the current room is not the escape room, so move east or south. Let's check the image again. The room has a desk, bookshelf, photos, which is an office, not a reception area. So move east.</think><answer><|begin_of_box|>MOVE: east<|end_of_box|></answer>",
