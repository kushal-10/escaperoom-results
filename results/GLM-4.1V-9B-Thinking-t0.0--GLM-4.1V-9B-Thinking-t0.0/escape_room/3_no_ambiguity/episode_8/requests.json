The description of the ESCAPE ROOM is a modern reception area with a white desk labeled \"twi\" at the center, people behind the desk, multiple clocks on the wall, bright open design, ceiling lights, bookshelves, clean professional atmosphere. The current room image shows what looks like a room with many electronic devices, maybe a lab or equipment room, which doesn't match the reception area description. So the current room is definitely not the ESCAPE ROOM. The available directions are east and south. I need to choose a direction. Let's pick east or south. Let's go with east. Wait, the action should be MOVE: chosen direction. So the response would be MOVE: east (or south, but need to check the options). Wait, the options are ['east', 'south']. Let me confirm. The current room doesn't match, so move. Let's choose east.</think><answer><|begin_of_box|>MOVE: east<|end_of_box|></answer>",
