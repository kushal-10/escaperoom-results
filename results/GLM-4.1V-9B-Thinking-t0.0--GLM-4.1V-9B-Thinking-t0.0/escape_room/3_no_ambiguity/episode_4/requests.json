Wait, the options given are ['east', 'south'] for the move action. Wait, the previous moves had different directions, but now the options are east or south. Let me check the image again. The current room is definitely not the escape room, so I need to move. Let's pick east. Wait, no, let me think. The room shown has kitchen elements, cabinets, a microwave, which are not part of the home theater description. So the room is not the escape room, so I should move. The action is MOVE: chosen direction. Let's choose east. Wait, but let me confirm. The current room is a kitchen, so definitely not the escape room. So the action is MOVE: east (or west, but the options are east, south). Wait, the options are ['east', 'south'] for the move action. So I'll choose east.</think><answer>MOVE: east\n</answer>",

The description of the ESCAPE ROOM is a home theater/escape room with a large projection screen, dark leather seating, dark curtains, wall-mounted speakers, wall sconce, patterned carpet, light cream walls, etc. The current room doesn't match that at all. It looks like a workshop or studio with easels, tables, and industrial elements. So it's definitely not the ESCAPE ROOM. The available directions are west and east. I need to choose a direction. Let's check the options. The action should be MOVE with a direction. Let's pick west or east. Let's see the image again. The room has easels, tables, and no theater elements. So move west or east. Let's choose west.</think><answer>MOVE: west\n</answer>",
