If the current room exactly matches the ESCAPE ROOM based on my description, respond strictly with -\nESCAPE\n\n2. If the current room seems similar to the ESCAPE ROOM but you are uncertain, ask me a clarifying question that focuses on visually distinguishing\nfeatures that can help you tell your current room apart from the ESCAPE ROOM described.\nRespond strictly with -\nQUESTION: your question\n\n3. If the current room is definitely not the ESCAPE ROOM, choose a direction from the available options: ['east', 'south']\nreply strictly with -\nMOVE: chosen direction\n\nWhat action do you choose?\n\nYou must follow the above format rules exactly.\nDo not respond in any other format. Do not provide any commentary or clarification.\n",
