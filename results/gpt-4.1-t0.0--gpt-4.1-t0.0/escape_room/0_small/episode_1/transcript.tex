	 DESCRIPTION: The ESCAPE ROOM is a small, dimly lit room with wood-paneled walls and a low white ceiling. There is a corner bar with a red padded front and a white countertop, accompanied by three metal bar stools. The floor near the bar has a patterned tile section, while the rest of the floor is carpeted. There are small windows high on the wall and some shelves behind the bar. A vent or fan is visible in the upper right corner of the back wall.
