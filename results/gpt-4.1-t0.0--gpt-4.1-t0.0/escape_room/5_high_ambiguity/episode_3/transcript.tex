There are two black office chairs, a large desk with a computer monitor, a keyboard, audio equipment, and headphones. Acoustic panels are mounted on the walls, and a flat-screen TV displaying a cityscape is hung above the desk. The room is softly lit with ceiling spotlights and a unique floor lamp in the corner.
