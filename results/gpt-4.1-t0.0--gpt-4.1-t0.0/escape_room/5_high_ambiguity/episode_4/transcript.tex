	 DESCRIPTION: The ESCAPE ROOM is a home theater with a large projection screen displaying the words "Digitally THX Mastered." The room features several comfortable chairs with a bold zebra print pattern. The walls are decorated with columns and wall sconces that emit warm light. The ceiling is dark, contrasting with the lighter walls and carpet. There is a window with a dark curtain on the right side of the room. The overall atmosphere is cozy and designed for watching movies.
