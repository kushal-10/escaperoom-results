	 DESCRIPTION: The TARGET ROOM is a modern office space with a clean and minimalist design. It features a central seating area with two black armchairs and a small white coffee table. There are two doors on either side of the room, one of which is slightly ajar, leading to another office area. The walls are painted in a light color, and the ceiling has a large, geometrically shaped light fixture that provides ample illumination. The floor is carpeted, and there are additional office cubicles
