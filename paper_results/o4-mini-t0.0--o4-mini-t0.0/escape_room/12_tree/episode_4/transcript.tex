	 DESCRIPTION: The room is a traditional, elegantly furnished living space with warm cream-colored walls and polished hardwood floors. A crystal chandelier hangs from the ceiling’s decorative medallion. Against one wall is a white marble fireplace topped by a large, gilded mirror and flanked by two table lamps with pleated shades. In front of the fireplace are a set of matching upholstered chairs in a pale fabric with dark wooden frames. A cushioned ottoman stands centrally on the floor. To the left, an open doorway leads into a formal dining area with a long table set with candlesticks, green draperies framing French doors, and another chandelier above. Plush sofas with decorative pillows complete the seating arrangement. The overall style is refined and classic, with soft pastels, gold accents, and period-inspired furnishings.
