	 DESCRIPTION: The image shows a spacious, traditionally styled hotel room with two double beds side by side. Each bed is made up with white linens and a patterned bedspread in warm earth tones; a folded garment rests on top of each spread. Between the beds is a dark wood nightstand holding a brass-based table lamp and a telephone. To the left, a small round wooden table is paired with two upholstered chairs in a muted fabric—one chair has an article of clothing draped over its back. A matching table lamp stands beside the table. Behind this seating area, a large window framed by floral-patterned curtains and valance offers a view of an exterior stone building. The walls are covered in light-colored wallpaper with subtle texture, and the floor is carpeted in a neutral tone. Crown molding runs along the ceiling.
