If the current room seems similar but you are uncertain, ask me a clarifying question, reply strictly with -\nQUESTION: your question\n\n3. If the current room is definitely not the TARGET ROOM, choose a direction from the available options: ['east']\nreply strictly with -\nMOVE: chosen direction\n\nWhat action do you choose?\n\nYou must follow the above format rules exactly.\nDo not respond in any other format. Do not provide any commentary or clarification.\n\n",
