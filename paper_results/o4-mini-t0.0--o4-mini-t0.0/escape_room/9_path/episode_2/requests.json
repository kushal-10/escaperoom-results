If the current room exactly matches the TARGET ROOM based on my description, respond strictly with -\nESCAPE\n\n2. If the current room seems similar but you are uncertain, ask me a clarifying question, reply strictly with -\nQUESTION: your question\n\n3. If the current room is definitely not the TARGET ROOM, choose a direction from the available options: ['south', 'north']\nreply strictly with -\nMOVE: chosen direction\n\nWhat action do you choose?\n\nYou must follow the above format rules exactly.\nDo not respond in any other format. Do not provide any commentary or clarification.\n\n"
