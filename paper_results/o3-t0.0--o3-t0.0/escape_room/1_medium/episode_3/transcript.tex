	 DESCRIPTION: A small, narrow bathroom with light beige tiles on the walls and floor. At the far end is a shower stall enclosed by a clear glass sliding door with frosted horizontal stripes in the middle. Inside the stall is a handheld showerhead attached to the wall with a hose. In front of the shower is a white toilet with the tank against the right wall. Mounted on that wall above the toilet is a small square metal fixture, likely a ventilation switch or control. To the left of the toilet hangs a white towel on a chrome towel bar. On the floor beside the toilet is a small stainless-steel pedal trash can. In the foreground on the right edge is part of a white sink basin. The ceiling has a recessed light providing bright illumination.
