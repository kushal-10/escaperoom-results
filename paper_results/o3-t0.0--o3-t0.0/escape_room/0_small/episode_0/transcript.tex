	 DESCRIPTION: A modern, well-lit lobby or reception area featuring warm wood paneling and sleek design. A curved wooden reception desk stretches along the left side where two people speak with staff behind it. Tall cylindrical wood columns with vertical light strips stand prominently, one near the center. The floor is covered with gray stone or tile. Overhead, recessed circular lights and black linear fixtures illuminate the space. In the background are glass panels, shelves, and a doorway leading deeper into the building. On the right, a slatted wood divider and a small table with a vase of white flowers add decorative touches.
