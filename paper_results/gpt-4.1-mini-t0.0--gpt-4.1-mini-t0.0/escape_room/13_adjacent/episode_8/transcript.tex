	 DESCRIPTION: The TARGET ROOM appears to be a reception or waiting area. It features a curved wooden reception desk with a woman standing behind it. The walls are painted a light green color. There is a potted plant on the reception desk. To the right, there is a seating area with a patterned green sofa and a wooden coffee table. A tall floor lamp with a white shade is positioned near the sofa, casting a warm light. The floor is tiled, and the ceiling has recessed lighting.
