Wait, the cabinets here are wooden, but the target mentioned a central white cabinet. Hmm, but the overall layout matches: hanging clothes, shelves with shoes, bench, rug. Let's check if it's exactly matching. The target has a central white cabinet with drawers and glass-fronted upper cabinets. The current image has wooden cabinets, but maybe the description's details—wait, the current room has multiple sections of hanging clothes (yes, there are clothes hanging), shelves with shoes (yes, there are shelves with shoes), a central cabinet (though wooden, maybe the description's cabinet type is flexible), a bench with a blanket (the bench has a cushion), and a large rug (the floor has a rug).
