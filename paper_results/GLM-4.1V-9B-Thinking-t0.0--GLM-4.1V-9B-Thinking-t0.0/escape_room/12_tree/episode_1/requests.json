Wait, but the options are south, east, north. Let's check the image again. The current room is a bathroom, so not matching. Therefore, move in a direction. Let's choose north? Wait, no, let's check the options. The action is to move, so reply with MOVE: direction. Let's pick north. Wait, but let's make sure. The current room is a bathroom, so definitely not the target.
