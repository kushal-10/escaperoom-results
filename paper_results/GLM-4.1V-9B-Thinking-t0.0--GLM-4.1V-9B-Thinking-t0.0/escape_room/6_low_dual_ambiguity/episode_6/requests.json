The target room is a cozy reading room with wooden bookshelves, maroon armchairs, a small table with lamp and books, large windows, and potted plants. The current room shown here has a computer setup, a box, a small table with items, but no bookshelves like the target, no armchairs, no lamp on a small table between chairs, no large windows with natural light, and no potted plants. So this room doesn't match the target. The available directions are east or south, but since the current room isn't the target, I need to move. Wait, the options for direction are ['east', 'south']? Wait, the previous moves had different directions, but now the options are east and south. Wait, the current room is definitely not the target, so I need to choose a direction. Let me check the image again. The current room has a computer desk, box, chair, but no bookshelves, armchairs, etc. So the action should be MOVE with a direction. Let's pick east or west? Wait, the options given are ['east', 'south']? Wait, the user's previous options might have changed, but in this case, the options are ['east', 'south']? Wait, the question says \"choose a direction from the available options: ['east', 'south']\" so I need to pick one. But let's confirm: the current room is not the target, so move. Let's say east. Wait, but let's check the image again. The current room is a small room with a computer, box, chair, no bookshelves. So definitely not the target. Therefore, move east or south. Let's choose east. Wait, but the format is MOVE: chosen direction. So the response should be MOVE: east (or south, but need to pick one). Wait, let's check the image again. The room has a window with blinds, a box, a small table, a chair, a computer desk. None of the target elements. So move.
