The TARGET ROOM is a university of Vermont reception area with a front desk, warm beige wall, Dell monitor, framed artwork, etc. The current image shows a classroom with sewing machines and kids, which doesn't match the reception area description. So the current room is definitely not the TARGET ROOM. The available directions are ['east', 'south'], so I need to choose a direction. Let's pick east or south? Wait, the options are ['east', 'south'], so let's choose one. Let's go with east. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the current image is a classroom, not the reception. So the action is MOVE: east (or south, but need to pick one). Wait, the options are ['east', 'south'], so let's choose east. Wait, no, let me check again. The current room is a classroom with sewing machines, which is not the reception area. So the action is MOVE: east (or south). Let's go with east.</think><answer><|begin_of_box|>MOVE: east<|end_of_box|></answer>", "label": "response"}}]]}
