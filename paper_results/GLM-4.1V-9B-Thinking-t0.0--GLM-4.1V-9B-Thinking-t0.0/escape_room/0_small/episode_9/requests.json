The TARGET ROOM description says: \"a spacious room with large windows allowing abundant natural light, featuring long wooden tables surrounded by chairs, and extensive wooden bookshelves filled with books along one wall. the room has a bright, open atmosphere with a view of greenery outside the windows.\"\n\nLooking at the current image: there are large windows with natural light, wooden bookshelves filled with books, chairs (the maroon ones), and the room has a bright atmosphere. Wait, does it have long wooden tables? The description mentions long wooden tables, but I need to check if this room matches. The current room has the bookshelves, chairs, windows with greenery view, etc. Wait, let me check again. The TARGET room has \"long wooden tables surrounded by chairs\" – does this room have that? The image shows chairs but maybe not long tables. Wait, no, let's check the current image again. The room has large windows (abundant natural light), extensive wooden bookshelves, chairs, and a view of greenery. But does it have long wooden tables? The description says \"long wooden tables surrounded by chairs\" – if the current room doesn't have long tables, then it's not matching. Wait, but maybe I made a mistake. Wait, the current image shows the same room as before, maybe? Wait, no, the previous images were different. Wait, the current image has the bookshelves, chairs, windows, but does it have long tables? The description says \"long wooden tables\" – if the current room doesn't have them, then it's not the TARGET room. But wait, let me check again. The TARGET room has \"long wooden tables surrounded by chairs\" – if the current room has chairs but no long tables, then it's not matching. But maybe the current room is the TARGET room? Wait, the description says \"spacious room with large windows allowing abundant natural light, featuring long wooden tables surrounded by chairs, and extensive wooden bookshelves filled with books along one wall. the room has a bright, open atmosphere with a view of greenery outside the windows.\" The current image has large windows, extensive bookshelves, chairs, and a view of greenery. But does it have long wooden tables? If not, then it's not the TARGET room. But wait, maybe the current room is the TARGET room. Wait, let me check the image again. The image shows chairs, bookshelves, windows, but no long tables. So if the current room doesn't have long wooden tables, then it's not the TARGET room. But the options for not matching are 'east' or 'south'. Wait, but maybe I made a mistake. Wait, the first image was a different room, then after moving, the current image is the same as the first one? No, the current image is similar but maybe not matching. Wait, the TARGET room has \"long wooden tables\" – if the current room doesn't have them, then it's not the TARGET room. So I need to choose a direction. But wait, the options are 'east' or 'south'. Wait, but maybe the current room is the TARGET room. Wait, let me check again. The description says \"long wooden tables surrounded by chairs\" – if the current room has chairs but no long tables, then it's not matching. So I should move. But which direction? The options are 'east' or 'south'. Let me think. Wait, maybe the current room is the TARGET room. Wait, the image has large windows, bookshelves, chairs, and greenery view. Maybe the long tables are there but not visible? No, the image doesn't show long tables. So I think the current room is not the TARGET room, so I need to move. But which direction? The options are 'east' or 'south'. Let me choose south. Wait, but the format says if not matching, choose from ['east', 'south'] and reply with MOVE: direction.
