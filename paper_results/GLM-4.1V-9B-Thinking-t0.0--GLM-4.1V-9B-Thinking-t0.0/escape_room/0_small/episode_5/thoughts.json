Wait, the current room has beige walls, modern ceiling lighting, seating with black armchairs and beige sofa around a small table, doors on the left, and open workspace area. The description matches quite closely. Let's check each element:\n\n- Beige walls: yes\n- Carpeted floor: the image shows carpet, so that's there\n- Contemporary ceiling lighting: the ceiling has modern lighting\n- Seating options: black armchairs and beige sofa around a small table: yes, there are black armchairs and a beige sofa with a small table\n- Doors on the left side: there are doors on the left\n- Open workspace area with desks and computer stations: in the background, there are desks and workstations\n- Small plant on one of the tables: there's a plant on a table\n\nSo this room matches the TARGET ROOM description.
