The image shows a living room with a sofa, rug, lamps, and artwork.

I need to choose a direction, but wait, the options are west or east. But first, I need to check if there are exits. Wait, the current room doesn't match, so I should move. But which direction? Wait, the problem says \"choose a direction from the available options: ['west', 'east']\" but I need to see if there are exits. Wait, the image shows a room with furniture, no musical instruments. So I need to move. But since I don't know the exits, but the format requires moving west or east. Let me check the current room again. It's a living room, not a music room. So I need to move.
