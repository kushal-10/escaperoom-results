Wait, the previous moves were west, east, etc. But the current room is not the target. So need to move. Wait, the direction options are ['west', 'east'] now. Let me check the image again. The current room has musical instruments, but the target is a studio control room. So the current room is not the target. Therefore, move in a direction. But which one? Wait, the previous moves were west, east, etc. But the current image is similar to the previous one with musical instruments. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Wait, the target room is a professional audio studio control room, while the current room has musical instruments but maybe not the control room setup. So the current room is not the target. Therefore, move. Let's choose west or east. Wait, the options are ['west', 'east']. Let's pick west. Wait, but need to check. Alternatively, maybe the current room is not the target, so move. Let's do MOVE: west. Wait, but let me confirm. The target has specific elements like mixing console with sliders, person at console, acoustic panels, etc. The current room has a mixing console but no person, no acoustic panels visible.
