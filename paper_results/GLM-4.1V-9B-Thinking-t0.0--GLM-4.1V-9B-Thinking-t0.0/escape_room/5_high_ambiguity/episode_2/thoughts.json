The target is a kitchen with light beige cabinets, white fridge, kitchen counter with sink, stove, dining table, shelves with food.

The current image has wooden cabinets (not light beige), a kitchen island, maybe a fridge? Wait, the image shows a kitchen with wooden cabinets, a kitchen island, a stove, sink, and maybe a dining area. But the description says light beige cabinets. So the current room is not the target.

The current image shows a kitchen with wooden cabinets (not light beige), a kitchen island, a stove, sink, maybe a dining area, but no white fridge, and the cabinets are wooden.

Wait, the image shows a kitchen with cabinets, stove, sink, etc. Wait, maybe I made a mistake.
