The target room description is about a home theater with beige walls, large screen, seating, speakers, etc. So the current room is not the target. Therefore, I need to move in one of the directions.

But first, check if I need to ask a question? No, because it's definitely not matching. So I need to move. But which direction? Wait, the action says \"choose a direction from the available options: ['west', 'east']\" but the image doesn't show directions, but maybe the standard is to pick one. Wait, the current room is a bathroom, so moving either west or east would be possible.
