The description of the TARGET ROOM is a professional recording studio with a large audio mixing console, audio equipment racks, speakers, computer with monitor, wooden walls, floor, tapestry, wall hangings. The current room has the mixing console, speakers, equipment racks, but the walls and floor don't match the wooden ones described. Wait, let's check the image again. The current room has gray walls and carpeted floor, not wooden. So does this match the TARGET ROOM? The TARGET has wooden walls and floor, decorative elements like tapestry. This room doesn't have those. Wait, but let's check the first image again. Wait, the current room in the third image (the one we're looking at now) has the mixing console, speakers, equipment racks, but the walls are gray, floor is carpet. The TARGET has wooden walls, floor, tapestry, etc. So this room is not the TARGET. Wait, but wait, let's check if it's similar. The first image (the one before the second move) was a recording studio, but the current one is the same as the first one? Wait, no, the second image was a living room, then the third image is back to the recording studio. Wait, the TARGET description has wooden walls, floor, tapestry, wall hangings. The current room has gray walls, carpet, no tapestry. So it's not the TARGET. But the options for the third action are ['west', 'east']. Wait, but let's check the current room again. The current room has the mixing console, speakers, equipment racks, but the walls and floor don't match. So it's not the TARGET. Therefore, we need to move. But which direction? Wait, the options are west or east. But let's check the image again. The current room is the recording studio, but it doesn't have the wooden elements. So it's not the TARGET. Therefore, we need to move. But let's confirm. The TARGET has wooden walls, floor, tapestry. The current room has gray walls, carpet, no tapestry. So it's not the TARGET. Therefore, the action is to move. But which direction? Wait, the options are west or east. But maybe I made a mistake. Wait, let's check the first image again. The first image was the recording studio, then the second was a living room, then the third is back to the recording studio. Wait, the TARGET is the recording studio with wooden elements. The current room (third image) is the same as the first image, but the walls and floor are not wooden. So it's not the TARGET. Therefore, we need to move. But the options are west or east. Wait, maybe the direction is west? Wait, no, let's think again. The current room has the mixing console, speakers, equipment racks, but the walls are gray. The TARGET has wooden walls. So this room is not the TARGET. Therefore, the action is to move. But which direction? The options are west or east. Let's check the image again. The room has the mixing console on the left, equipment racks on the right. If we move west, would that lead somewhere? But the instruction says if not TARGET, choose west or east. So let's pick west. Wait, but let's confirm. The current room is not the TARGET, so we need to move. Therefore, the action is MOVE: west. Wait, but let me check the image again. The current room has the same elements as the first image, but the walls and floor are different. So it's not the TARGET. Therefore, the action is to move.
