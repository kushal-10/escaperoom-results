The target is a reception area with wooden paneling, counter, mirror, people interacting, informational materials, phone. The current room has a reception desk (wooden counter, paneling maybe), but let's check. Wait, the image shows a reception area with the desk, but does it have the mirror, people, phone, etc.? The current room might not have the mirror or people. Wait, the first image was similar, then moved west, now this image. Wait, the target has people interacting, mirror, phone, informational materials. The current room doesn't show those elements. So it's not the target. So need to move. But the options are ['west', 'east']. Wait, let's check the room. The current room has the reception desk but lacks the mirror, people, phone. So it's not the target. So move. But which direction? Wait, the previous move was west, now maybe east? Wait, no, need to check. Wait, the target has people interacting, mirror, phone. The current room doesn't have those. So move. Let's choose east? Wait, no, maybe west? Wait, no, let's think. The current room is a reception area but missing the mirror and people. So it's not the target. So move. Let's say move east? Wait, no, the options are ['west', 'east']. Wait, the first image was the same as the current one? Wait, no, the first image was the one before moving, then moved west, now the image is the same as the first one? Wait, no, the user provided the current image.
