The target room is a hotel room with two double beds, patterned bedspreads, white pillows, floral curtains, a large window with a view of a stone building, a small round table with chairs, lamps, neutral walls and carpet. The current room has multiple single beds, plain walls, no curtains or windows with stone building views, no table or lamps. So it's definitely not the target room. The direction options are ['south', 'east'], but wait, the action says if not target, choose direction from ['south', 'east']? Wait, the previous moves had different directions, but now the options are south or east. Wait, the current room is definitely not the target, so we need to move. Let's check the direction.
