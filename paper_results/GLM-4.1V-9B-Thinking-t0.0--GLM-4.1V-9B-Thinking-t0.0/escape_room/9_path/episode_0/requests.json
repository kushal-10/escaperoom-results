The target is a bedroom with a large dark wooden bed, floral-patterned bedspread with purple flowers on light yellow base, yellow pillows, purple throw blanket, two matching dark wooden nightstands with lamps, light green walls, three windows with white shutters, dark wood flooring, cozy well-lit. The current room has a bed with pink cover, dark wooden dresser, light walls, window with curtains, gray flooring. This doesn't match the target's details. So it's not the target room. Need to choose direction. But wait, the options are east or west. Wait, the current room doesn't match, so move. But let's check again. The target has dark wooden bed, floral bedspread, etc. Current has pink bedspread, different furniture. So not matching. Therefore, move. But which direction? Wait, the options are ['east', 'west'], so need to pick one. But maybe the image is the same as before? Wait, no, the last image was the one with the artist, then the craft room, then the artist again, then the craft room, then the artist, then the craft room, then this bedroom. So this bedroom is not the target. So move. Let's say move west or east. But let's check the description again. The target has dark wooden bed, floral bedspread (purple flowers), yellow pillows, purple throw, two nightstands with lamps, light green walls, three windows with white shutters, dark wood flooring. The current room has pink bedspread, light walls, window with curtains, dark wooden dresser (not nightstand), gray flooring. So definitely not the target. So move. Let's choose west or east. Let's say move west. Wait, but the action is to move. So reply with MOVE: west or east. Let's confirm. The current room is not the target, so move. So the action is MOVE: west (or east, either is fine as long as it's one of the options).</think><answer>MOVE: west</answer>", "response": "MOVE: west"}}, {"timestamp": "2025-07-16T17:13:03.731138", "manipulated_prompt_obj": {"inputs": "[gMASK]<sop><|user|>\nYou are the SEEKER in MapWorld, a network of interconnected rooms.\n\nYour objective is to find and reach the TARGET ROOM.\n\nI have the image of the TARGET ROOM and will describe it to you.\n\nAt each step, you will be shown an image of your current room.\n\nYou may perform only one of the following actions:\n\n1.

The bed is dark wooden, nightstands are dark, lamps are there, walls are light green, windows with shutters (though maybe not three, but the description says three, but maybe the image has multiple).
