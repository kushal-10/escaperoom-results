The TARGET ROOM is described as a cozy attic with slanted ceilings, two metal bunk beds, brick wall, small table with chairs, striped rug, hanging lights, yellow walls, framed pictures, clock, and a staircase with white railings. The current room doesn't match that description at all. It has a different setup, no bunk beds, no brick wall, no staircase, etc. So since it's definitely not the TARGET ROOM, I need to choose a direction. The options are east or south. Let's check the image again. The current room has a different layout, so moving east or south. Let's pick one, say east. Wait, the action should be MOVE: chosen direction. So the response would be MOVE: east (or west, etc., but need to check the options). Wait, the options given are ['east', 'south'] for this step. So let's confirm the current room doesn't match.
