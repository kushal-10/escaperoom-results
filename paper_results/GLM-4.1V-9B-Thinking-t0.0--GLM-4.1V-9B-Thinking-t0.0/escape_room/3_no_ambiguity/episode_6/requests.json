The TARGET ROOM is described as a spacious room with large windows, long wooden tables, chairs, extensive wooden bookshelves, bright open atmosphere, mix of wooden furniture, and ample seating. The current room shown is a small attic-like room with a bed, stuffed animals, a small shelf, and framed pictures. This doesn't match the TARGET ROOM's description at all. So, since it's not the TARGET ROOM, I need to choose a direction. The options are 'west' or 'east', but I need to pick one. Wait, the action is to move, so I'll choose a direction. Let me check the options again. The available directions are ['west', 'east']? Wait, the previous moves had different directions, but now the options are 'west' or 'east'. So I'll pick one, say west. But the format is MOVE: chosen direction. So the response should be MOVE: west (or east, but need to pick). Wait, the current room is definitely not the TARGET, so move.
