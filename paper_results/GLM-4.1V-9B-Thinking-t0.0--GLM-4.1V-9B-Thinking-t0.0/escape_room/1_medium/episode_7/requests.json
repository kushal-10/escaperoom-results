The TARGET ROOM has beige walls, brown carpet, white trim along baseboards, recessed ceiling lights, a small window with outside view, structural white columns, and a wooden door on the right. The current room has wooden tables, chairs, lamps, and a clock, which doesn't match the TARGET's features. So it's definitely not the TARGET. The options are east or south, but wait, the options given here are ['east', 'south']? Wait, the previous options were ['west', 'east'] but now it's ['east', 'south']. Wait, the current room doesn't match, so we need to move. Let's check the room again. The current room has wooden furniture, no columns, no window view, no white trim. So it's not the TARGET. Therefore, choose a direction. Let's pick east or south. Wait, the action is to choose direction from ['east', 'south'], so let's say MOVE: east. Wait, but need to check if the room matches.
