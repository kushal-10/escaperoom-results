The current room shows a recording studio with a large mixing console, audio equipment, which is related but let's check if it matches. Wait, the target has musical instruments (guitars, drum set) and the current room has recording equipment but maybe not the instruments. Wait, the image shows a recording studio with mixing console, which is part of a music studio but does it match the target's description? The target says \"music practice room containing various musical instruments and equipment\" â€“ the current room has equipment but maybe not the instruments. Wait, let's check the description again. The target has guitars, drum set, amplifiers, speakers, posters. The current room has a mixing console, audio gear, but no guitars or drum set visible. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Wait, the current room is a recording studio, which is a type of music studio, but does it match the target's description? The target says \"music practice room\" with instruments. The current room might be a recording studio which is different from a practice room. Wait, but let's check the image again. The image shows a recording studio with a large mixing console, audio equipment, wooden walls, but no guitars or drum set.

The target has musical instruments, this room has recording equipment. So not matching. Therefore, move. So the response is MOVE: west (or east, southâ€”any of the options). Wait, but let's check the image again. The room has a mixing console, which is recording equipment, not practice instruments. So it's not the target. Therefore, move.
