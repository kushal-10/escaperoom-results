The target room is a cozy reading room with wooden bookshelves, maroon armchairs, a small table with lamp and books, large windows, and potted plants. The current room shown is a locker room or storage area with lockers and benches, which doesn't match the target. So the action should be moving in a direction. The options are east, south, west. Since the current room is not the target, we need to move. Let's check the image again. The current room has lockers and a bench, so definitely not the target. Therefore, choose a direction. Let's say east or west? Wait, the previous moves might have context, but the current image is a locker room. So the action is MOVE: east or west?
