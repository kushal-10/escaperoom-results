Wait, the user's last message was the computer lab image, and I moved east. Now, the next image would be the one after moving east. But since I can't see that, I need to decide based on the target. The target has a reception desk with people. The current room (after moving east) – but I don't have the next image. Wait, no, the process is: each step you get the current room image, then choose action. So first, the initial image was the computer lab. I moved east. Now, the next image would be the room east of that. But since I can't see it, I have to proceed. Wait, no, the user's instruction is: after moving, you get the next image, then choose action. But in the current context, the user provided the computer lab image, and I moved east. Now, the next step is to get the image of the room east of that. But since I can't, I have to follow the rules.

Then the user says \"Now you made a move to this room, you can choose one of the following three actions...\" So the next step is, after moving east, the current room is the one east of the computer lab. But since I can't see that image, I have to assume. Wait, no, the user is simulating the game. So the process is: you (seeker) are in a room, get the image, choose action. So first image: computer lab. I moved east. Now, the next image is the room east of the computer lab. Let's assume that room. But since I can't see it, I have to proceed. Wait, no, the user's target is the lobby with reception desk, columns, etc. The computer lab is not that. So after moving east, if the next room is still not the target, I have to move again. But the available directions are east or south. So I need to choose a direction. Let's pick east again. Wait, no, the available options are east or south. So I have to choose one. Let's go east.
