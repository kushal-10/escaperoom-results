The target room description has large windows, wooden tables/chairs, display cases on left, table lamps, closed door in background, carpeted floor, light-colored walls. Now look at the current image. The current room has shelves with colorful containers, a table with various items, wall decorations, and no windows, wooden furniture as described, or display cases. So the current room doesn't match. Need to choose between east or south. But wait, the target has a closed door in background. The current image doesn't show a closed door matching that. So the current room is not the target. Now, choose a direction. But wait, the options are east or south. Let's check the image. The current room's layout—since we need to move, but the target has specific features. Since the current room doesn't match, we have to move. But which direction? Wait, the problem is to choose between east or south. But maybe the image doesn't show those directions. Wait, the user's instruction is to choose either east or south. Let's pick one.

Wait, the target's description includes display cases on the left wall. The current image's left has shelves with containers, not display cases. So the current room is not the target.
