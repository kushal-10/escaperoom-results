The current room has shelves with colorful containers, a table with various items, wall decorations, and no windows, wooden furniture as described, or display cases.

So the current room is not the target. Now, choose a direction. But wait, the options are east or south. Let's check the image. The current room's layout—since we need to move, but the target has specific features. Since the current room doesn't match, we have to move. But which direction? Wait, the problem is to choose between east or south. But maybe the image doesn't show those directions. Wait, the user's instruction is to choose either east or south. Let's pick one. But maybe the correct action is to move. Wait, the target has a closed door in background. The current room doesn't have that. So the current room is not the target. So we need to move. Let's choose a direction. Let's say south. Wait, but maybe the answer is to move. Wait, the options are ['east', 'south']. So the answer should be MOVE: south or MOVE: east. But how to decide? Wait, the target's description includes display cases on the left wall. The current image's left has shelves with containers, not display cases. So the current room is not the target.
