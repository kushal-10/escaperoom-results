The target room is a modern bathroom with a toilet, shower, tiles, sink, trash bin, bright lighting. The current image is a computer lab with old CRT monitors, tables, chairs, people. These are completely different. So the current room is definitely not the target. The available directions are north or east. Since we need to move, but wait, the options are north or east.
