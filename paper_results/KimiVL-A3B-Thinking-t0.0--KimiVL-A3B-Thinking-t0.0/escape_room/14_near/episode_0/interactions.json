The user is the SEEKER in MapWorld, and I need to figure out the next move. The target room has a wooden closet system with shelves holding folded clothes, storage boxes, and stacked items.

The description of the target room is more about a closet with specific features. The current room doesn't match that description. The available directions are west or east.
