The target room description is a bright modern space with white walls, white tables with laptops, white office chairs, stone-tiled exterior, long ceiling lights, and visible electrical cords. The current image shows a classroom with old CRT computers, blue chairs, posters on brick walls, a chalkboard. \n\nCompare the two: the current room has older tech (CRT monitors), brick walls (not white), posters instead of the described elements. So it's not the target. Now, check if it's definitely not the target. Yes, because the elements like white walls, modern tables with laptops, stone exterior, etc., don't match. So the action is MOVE: west (assuming west is a direction, but wait, need to choose between west or south. Wait, the current room doesn't match, so choose a direction. Since the target is different, move. But the options are west or south. Wait, the user says \"choose a direction from the available options: ['west', 'south']\". So pick one. But how?
