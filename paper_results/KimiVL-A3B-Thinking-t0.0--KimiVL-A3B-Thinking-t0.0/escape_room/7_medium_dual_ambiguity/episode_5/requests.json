The target room description mentions a central equipment with a grid of illuminated buttons, shelves with tools, windows with closed blinds, neutral walls, technical/industrial ambiance. The current room is a kitchen with a stove, microwave, cabinets, etc. It's a residential kitchen, not matching the target's industrial/control room. So the current room is definitely not the target. Need to choose between west or east. But wait, the image shows a kitchen. Since the target is industrial, the current room is wrong. So move to the next room. But the options are west or east. Wait, the problem is to move if not the target. So the action is MOVE: [direction]. But which direction? Wait, the user hasn't provided the layout, but the task is to move. Since the current room is a kitchen, not the target, we need to move. But the options are west or east. Wait, maybe the next room is the target. But how to choose? Wait, the instructions say if the current room is definitely not the target, choose a direction. So we have to pick either west or east. But maybe the correct move is to go to the next room, which might be the target. But since we don't have the layout, we have to make a choice. Wait, the target is an industrial room, current is a kitchen. So move to the next room. Let's assume that moving east or west would lead to the target. But the user expects a MOVE action. So pick one. Wait, maybe the answer is MOVE: east or MOVE: west. But how to decide? Wait, the problem is that the current room is not the target, so we must move. The options are west or east. Since the user hasn't provided the layout, but the task is to proceed, we have to choose one. Let's pick MOVE: east. Wait, no, maybe the correct direction is based on typical layouts. But without more info, we have to choose. Wait, the target is an industrial room, current is a kitchen. So move to the next room. Let's go MOVE: east. Wait, no, maybe the answer is MOVE: west. Wait, no, the user wants the action. Let's think again. The current room is a kitchen, not the target. So we must move. The options are west or east. Let's choose MOVE: east.
