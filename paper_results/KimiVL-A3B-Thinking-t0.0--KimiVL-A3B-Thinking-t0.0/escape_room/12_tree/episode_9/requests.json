There are columns on the left, adding to the elegant feel. The walls are light-colored, maybe beige or off-white. There's a rug under the table, and some decorative items like plants or vases on the table. The overall ambiance is sophisticated and classic, typical of a formal dining space.\n\nNow, structure the description clearly.

A grand chandelier hangs above the table, providing ambient lighting. Large columns flank the left side of the room, adding a touch of classical architecture.
