The target room description says it's a small enclosed space with white walls, carpeted floor, built-in shelf with AC unit, fluorescent light, closet/storage with no windows. Now look at the image: it's a closet with shelves, clothes, boxes, no AC unit visible, and the description doesn't match. So the current room isn't the target. Need to choose between north or west. But wait, the options are only north or west. Wait, the image shows a closet, but the target is a closet/storage with no windows, but the image has items. Wait, no—wait the target description says \"no visible windows or additional furniture\". The image has shelves, clothes, boxes—so the current room is not the target. So move. But which direction? Wait, the problem is that the user hasn't provided the image's layout, but the options are north or west. Wait, no—wait the user is the SEEKER, and the image is the current room.
