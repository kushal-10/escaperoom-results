The current room shown is a bedroom with beds, desk, wardrobe, stone walls, etc. So the current room doesn't match the target. Need to choose between west or east. Since the image doesn't show those directions, but the task is to move. Wait, the rules say if not target, choose west or east. But how to decide? Wait, maybe the initial image is the current room, and we need to move. But the problem is, the user hasn't provided the current room's image in the query. Wait, no, the user provided the target description, and the first image is the current room. Wait, the first image is the current room.
