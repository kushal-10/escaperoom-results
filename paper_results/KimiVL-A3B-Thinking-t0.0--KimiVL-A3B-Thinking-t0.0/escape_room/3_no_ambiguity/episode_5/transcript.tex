	 DESCRIPTION: The TARGET ROOM features a large bed with a dark leather headboard, dressed in white linens and a red accent runner, accompanied by white pillows and a red decorative pillow. Flanking the bed are two dark wooden bedside tables, each holding a black lampshade. Above the bed, a round mirror is mounted on an orange wall. To the left, floor - to - ceiling beige curtains cover a window, allowing light to filter into the room. The carpet is dark brown, and the overall ambiance is warm and inviting.
