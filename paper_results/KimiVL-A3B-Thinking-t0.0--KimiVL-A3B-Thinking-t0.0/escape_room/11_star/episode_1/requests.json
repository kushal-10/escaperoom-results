The target room description mentions two single beds, a CRT TV on a wooden nightstand with two drawers, tiled floor, plain light walls. The current room is a closet with clothes, shoes, shelves. So the current room doesn't match the target. Now, check if it's definitely not the target. Since the target has beds and a TV/nightstand, while current is a closet, so move to a direction. But the options are north or south. Wait, the image shows a closet, so maybe the layout—since we need to choose a direction. But the problem is, the current room isn't the target, so we have to move. But how to choose between north or south? Wait, the user might have a specific layout. But since the current room is a closet, and the target is a bedroom with beds, the current room is not the target. So we need to move. But the options are north or south. Since the image doesn't show direction, but the task is to choose one. Wait, the instructions say if the current room is definitely not the target, choose a direction from ['north', 'south'].

So perhaps the closet is in a room where moving north or south leads to another room. But the task is to choose one. So the answer must be MOVE: north or MOVE: south. But how to pick? Wait, maybe the correct action is to move, but the direction is arbitrary? No, that's not right. Wait, the problem is that the current room is definitely not the target, so we have to move. But the options are north or south. Since the user wants an action, and the correct format is MOVE: chosen direction. So I need to pick one. But maybe the answer is MOVE: north. Or MOVE: south.
