The target room has a wooden closet with shelves, folded clothes, storage boxes, a cushioned bench, an arched window with white trim, and light-colored floor. The current image shows a bedroom with a bed, nightstands, lamps, a dark cabinet, and a door. None of these match the target room's description. So the current room is definitely not the target. Need to choose between west or east. Since the options are west or east, and the current room isn't the target, move. But wait, the image doesn't show directions. Wait, the problem says at each step, choose a direction from ['west', 'east']. But how do we know which direction? Wait, maybe the initial setup—wait, no, the user is the SEEKER, and the current room is shown. The target is described. The current image is a bedroom, which doesn't match. So the action is to move west or east. But since the image doesn't provide spatial info, but the rules say choose one of the two. Wait, maybe the correct action is to move, but which direction? Wait, no, the problem might have a standard, but since the current room isn't the target, we have to pick either west or east. But maybe the answer is to move west? Wait, no, the user hasn't provided the layout. Wait, no, the task is to follow the format. Wait, the current room is not the target, so choose a direction. Let's pick west. Wait, no, maybe east. Wait, no, the correct action is to move, so the answer is MOVE: west or MOVE: east. But how to decide? Wait, the problem says \"choose a direction from the available options: ['west', 'east']\". Since the current room isn't the target, we have to pick one. But maybe the answer is MOVE: west. Wait, no, maybe the correct answer is to move, but the direction is arbitrary? No, that can't be. Wait, no, the user must have a way. Wait, no, the problem is that the current room is not the target, so the action is to move. Let's check the description again. The target has a wooden closet, shelves, clothes, boxes, bench, window. The current image is a bedroom with bed, nightstands, lamps, cabinet. So they are different. Therefore, the current room is not the target. So the action is to move west or east. Since the options are west or east, and the problem requires choosing one, perhaps the answer is MOVE: west. Wait, no, maybe east. Wait, no, the correct answer is to move, so the answer is MOVE: west.
