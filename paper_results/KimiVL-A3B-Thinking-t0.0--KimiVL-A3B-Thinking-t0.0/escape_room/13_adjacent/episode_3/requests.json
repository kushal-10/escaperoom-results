The target room has musical instruments like guitars, drum set, amplifiers, speakers, Beatles poster, calendar, carpeted. The current room is a living room with couch, chairs, lamps, rug, sliding doors. No musical instruments here. So the current room isn't the target. Need to move. But where? The options are west or east. Wait, the current image doesn't show directions. But since the target is about music, and current is living room, maybe move towards areas with music gear. But the rules say if not target, choose west or east. Since the image doesn't show direction, but we have to pick. Wait, the problem is the current room is not the target, so choose a direction. But how? Wait, the user will describe the next room. But in the first step, the current room is the one shown. So since the current room doesn't match the target (no music gear), we have to move. But which direction? The options are west or east. Since the image doesn't provide info, but maybe the next step's room might have music. But the task is to choose between west or east. Wait, the user's instruction says: if the current room is definitely not the target, choose a direction from ['west', 'east']. So we have to pick one. But how? Maybe the answer is to move, but the correct action is to choose either. Wait, but the target room is about music, so maybe the current room is not, so move.

Wait, no, the first step is to process the current room. The current room is a living room with no music instruments, so it's not the target. So we have to move. But which direction? The options are west or east. Since the image doesn't show, but the user expects an action. Wait, maybe the answer is to move west or east. But the correct format is MOVE: chosen direction. But how to choose? Wait, maybe the answer is to move west. But I need to check. Wait, the target room has musical instruments, so the current room is not. So move. But the direction is unknown.
