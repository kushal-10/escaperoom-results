The target room description has large wooden shelves with magazines/books, armchairs, side table with pink lamp and open book, windows, plants, carpeted floor, and a framed picture.

But maybe the layout—since we don't have info, but the task is to move. Let's choose one. Wait, the current room is a bedroom, target is a different room. So move. Let's pick 'west' or 'east'.
