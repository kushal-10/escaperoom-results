The target room description has large wooden shelves with magazines/books, armchairs, side table with pink lamp and open book, windows, plants, carpeted floor, and a framed picture. The current image shows a bedroom with two beds, a nightstand with a lamp, phone, etc. None of these elements match the target room's description. So the current room is definitely not the target. Need to choose a direction: west or east. Since the image doesn't show the target, but the current room is not it, move. Let's pick a direction. Wait, the options are west or east. But maybe the layout—since we don't have info, but the task is to move. Let's choose one. Wait, the current room is a bedroom, target is a different room. So move. Let's pick 'west' or 'east'.
