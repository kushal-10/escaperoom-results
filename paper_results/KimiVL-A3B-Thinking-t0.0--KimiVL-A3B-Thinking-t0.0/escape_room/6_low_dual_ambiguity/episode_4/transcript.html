        <p>DESCRIPTION: The TARGET ROOM is a home theater featuring multiple brown reclining theater seats arranged in rows. A large screen at the front displays an animated scene (likely from &quot;Finding Nemo&quot;). The room is illuminated by blue ambient lighting and wall - mounted sconces. A ceiling - mounted projector is positioned above the screen, and a doorway is visible in the background. The flooring appears to be carpeted, creating a cozy, cinematic atmosphere.</p>

        <p>◁think▷Got it, let&#x27;s see. The target room is a home theater with brown reclining seats, a big screen showing Nemo, blue ambient lighting, wall sconces, a ceiling projector, carpeted floor, and a doorway. The current room is a bathroom with a tub, toilet, seahorse tiles, and a skylight. Definitely not the target. So need to move. But wait, the options are west or east. Wait, the current image is a bathroom, so which direction to go? Wait, the problem is that the user hasn&#x27;t provided the current room&#x27;s possible directions, but the task is to choose between west or east. Wait, no, the user is the SEEKER, and the current room is shown. The target is the home theater. Since the current room is a bathroom, which is not the target, so we need to move. But the options are west or east. Wait, maybe the bathroom has exits. But the user hasn&#x27;t specified, but the rules say to choose between west or east. Wait, the current image is a bathroom, so the possible moves are west or east. But how to decide? Wait, no, the target is a home theater, so the current room is a bathroom, so we need to move.
