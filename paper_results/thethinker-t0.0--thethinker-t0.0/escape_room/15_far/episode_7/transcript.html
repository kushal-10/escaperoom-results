        <p>&lt;think&gt;Got it, let&#x27;s look at the image. The TARGET ROOM is a reception or waiting area. Let&#x27;s describe the elements: there&#x27;s a curved reception desk on the left with a flower arrangement. There are several armchairs arranged around the room, with a large area rug. The room has beige curtains on one side, a ceiling with fluorescent lights, and a framed picture on the wall. There&#x27;s also a glass partition leading to another area. The overall style is modern office with neutral colors, furniture, and decorative elements like plants and a rug.&lt;/think&gt;&lt;answer&gt;DESCRIPTION: A modern office reception/waiting area featuring a curved reception desk with a floral arrangement on top, several gray armchairs arranged around the room, a large patterned area rug, beige curtains on one side, a ceiling with fluorescent lighting, a framed artwork on the wall, and a glass partition leading to another space. The room has a neutral color scheme with light walls and carpet.&lt;/answer&gt;</p>

        <p>You are the SEEKER in MapWorld, a network of interconnected rooms.<br/><br/>Your objective is to find and reach the TARGET ROOM.<br/><br/>I have the image of the TARGET ROOM and will describe it to you.<br/><br/>At each step, you will be shown an image of your current room.<br/><br/>You may perform only one of the following actions:<br/><br/>1. If the current room exactly matches the TARGET ROOM based on my description, respond strictly with -<br/>ESCAPE<br/><br/>2. If the current room seems similar but you are uncertain, ask me a clarifying question, reply strictly with -<br/>QUESTION: your question<br/><br/>3. If the current room is definitely not the TARGET ROOM, choose a direction from the available options: [&#x27;north&#x27;, &#x27;east&#x27;]<br/>reply strictly with -<br/>MOVE: chosen direction<br/><br/>Here is the description of the TARGET ROOM:<br/>description: a modern office reception/waiting area featuring a curved reception desk with a floral arrangement on top, several gray armchairs arranged around the room, a large patterned area rug, beige curtains on one side, a ceiling with fluorescent lighting, a framed artwork on the wall, and a glass partition leading to another space. the room has a neutral color scheme with light walls and carpet.<br/>What action do you choose?<br/><br/>You must follow the above format rules exactly.<br/>Do not respond in any other format. Do not provide any commentary or clarification.<br/><br/></p>
    </div>

    <div speaker="Player 2 (Explorer) to Game Master" class="msg b-gm" style="">
        <p>&lt;think&gt;Let me analyze the current room image and compare it with the target room description.<br/><br/>The current room shows:<br/>- A room with bookshelves filled with books<br/>- A wooden desk with office equipment<br/>- A person standing near a door<br/>- Wooden flooring<br/>- A skylight window<br/>- No reception desk, no floral arrangement, no gray armchairs, no area rug, no curtains, no ceiling with fluorescent lighting, no framed artwork, and no glass partition<br/><br/>The target room description is:<br/>- A modern office reception/waiting area<br/>- Curved reception desk with floral arrangement<br/>- Several gray armchairs<br/>- Large patterned area rug<br/>- Beige curtains<br/>- Ceiling with fluorescent lighting<br/>- Framed artwork on the wall<br/>- Glass partition<br/>- Neutral color scheme with light walls and carpet<br/><br/>The current room is definitely not the target room. It appears to be a library or study room with bookshelves, not a reception/waiting area. The current room has wooden floors, bookshelves, a desk with office equipment, and a person, which doesn&#x27;t match the target room&#x27;s description at all.<br/><br/>Since the current room is not the target room, I need to choose a direction from the available options [&#x27;north&#x27;, &#x27;east&#x27;].<br/><br/>Looking at the image, I can see the room has walls around it, but I don&#x27;t see clear directional indicators like doors labeled north or east. However, I need to choose one of the specified directions. Based on the layout, if I were to move, I would likely move in a direction that would take me toward a different room.<br/><br/>Since I need to choose between north and east, I&#x27;ll need to make a decision based on the visible layout. The room appears to have a door on the left side, and if I assume north is forward and east would be to the right, I might choose east or north. But without clear directional markers, I&#x27;ll choose one of the options.&lt;/think&gt;&lt;answer&gt;MOVE: north<br/>&lt;/answer&gt;</p>

        <p>Now you made a move to this room, you can choose one of the following three actions:<br/><br/>1. If the current room exactly matches the TARGET ROOM based on my description, respond strictly with -<br/>ESCAPE<br/><br/>2.
