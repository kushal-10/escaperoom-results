        <p>&lt;think&gt;I&#x27;m looking at the image provided, which shows what appears to be a recording studio or audio mixing room. Let me describe the TARGET ROOM as requested:<br/><br/>The image shows a professional audio recording studio control room. There&#x27;s a large mixing console with numerous sliders, buttons, and knobs. A person is sitting in a red chair at the console, working with what appears to be a piece of paper or script. <br/><br/>The room has soundproofing with gray acoustic wall panels. There are several studio monitors (speakers) on wooden surfaces, including black speakers with visible woofers and tweeters. There are also computer monitors visible on the console. The room has a professional audio equipment rack with various processors and amplifiers. There&#x27;s a framed poster or artwork on the wall with some text and colorful imagery. The overall environment suggests this is a professional audio production or recording studio.<br/><br/>I&#x27;ll provide this description in the requested format.&lt;/think&gt;&lt;answer&gt;DESCRIPTION: This is a professional audio recording studio control room. It features a large mixing console with numerous sliders, buttons, and knobs. A person is seated in a red chair at the console, working with what appears to be a piece of paper. The room has soundproofing with gray acoustic wall panels. There are several studio monitors (speakers) on wooden surfaces, including black speakers with visible woofers and tweeters. Computer monitors are positioned on the console, and there&#x27;s a professional audio equipment rack with various processors and amplifiers. A framed poster with colorful artwork hangs on the wall. The room has a professional audio production environment with dark flooring and organized equipment setup.&lt;/answer&gt;</p>

        <p>You are the SEEKER in MapWorld, a network of interconnected rooms.<br/><br/>Your objective is to find and reach the TARGET ROOM.<br/><br/>I have the image of the TARGET ROOM and will describe it to you.<br/><br/>At each step, you will be shown an image of your current room.<br/><br/>You may perform only one of the following actions:<br/><br/>1. If the current room exactly matches the TARGET ROOM based on my description, respond strictly with -<br/>ESCAPE<br/><br/>2. If the current room seems similar but you are uncertain, ask me a clarifying question, reply strictly with -<br/>QUESTION: your question<br/><br/>3. If the current room is definitely not the TARGET ROOM, choose a direction from the available options: [&#x27;west&#x27;, &#x27;north&#x27;]<br/>reply strictly with -<br/>MOVE: chosen direction<br/><br/>Here is the description of the TARGET ROOM:<br/>description: this is a professional audio recording studio control room. it features a large mixing console with numerous sliders, buttons, and knobs. a person is seated in a red chair at the console, working with what appears to be a piece of paper. the room has soundproofing with gray acoustic wall panels. there are several studio monitors (speakers) on wooden surfaces, including black speakers with visible woofers and tweeters. computer monitors are positioned on the console, and there&#x27;s a professional audio equipment rack with various processors and amplifiers. a framed poster with colorful artwork hangs on the wall. the room has a professional audio production environment with dark flooring and organized equipment setup.<br/>What action do you choose?<br/><br/>You must follow the above format rules exactly.<br/>Do not respond in any other format.

    <div speaker="Player 2 (Explorer) to Game Master" class="msg b-gm" style="">
        <p>&lt;think&gt;Let me analyze the current image and compare it with the target room description.<br/><br/>The current image shows what appears to be a computer lab or office space with multiple desktop computers with CRT monitors, keyboards, and mice on desks. There are rows of computers with white monitors, and the room appears to be an office or computer lab environment. This doesn&#x27;t match the professional audio recording studio control room description at all.<br/><br/>The target room description mentions:<br/>- Professional audio recording studio control room<br/>- Large mixing console with sliders, buttons, and knobs<br/>- Person in red chair at console<br/>- Soundproofing with gray acoustic wall panels<br/>- Studio monitors (speakers) on wooden surfaces<br/>- Computer monitors on console<br/>- Professional audio equipment rack<br/>- Framed poster with colorful artwork<br/>- Dark flooring and organized equipment setup<br/><br/>The current image shows a computer lab with standard office computers, not an audio studio. So this is definitely not the target room.<br/><br/>Since I need to choose a direction from [&#x27;west&#x27;, &#x27;north&#x27;], I should move in one of those directions to search for the target room. I&#x27;ll choose north as my direction.&lt;/think&gt;&lt;answer&gt;MOVE: north&lt;/answer&gt;</p>
