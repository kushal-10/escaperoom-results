	 <think>I'm looking at the image provided, which shows what appears to be a home theater or media room. Let me describe the TARGET ROOM as requested:\\ \tt \\ \tt The image shows a dimly lit room with a home theater setup. There are several beige/cream-colored reclining chairs arranged in a row facing a large projection screen. The screen is displaying what appears to be a sports event or game, with a crowd visible. The room has a sloped ceiling with recessed lighting fixtures. The floor is carpeted in a warm brown/beige tone. The walls appear to be dark brown or maroon, creating a dark environment ideal for viewing a screen. There's a projector mounted near the ceiling, and the room has a cozy, intimate feel with the seating arrangement. There appear to be some built-in shelves or cabinets on one wall.\\ \tt \\ \tt I'll provide this description in the requested format.</think><answer>DESCRIPTION: A dimly lit home theater room with a sloped ceiling.

	 <think>Got it, let's analyze the current room. The image shows what appears to be a small room with a large mirror, some furniture, and a view of another room. The target room is described as a home theater with reclining chairs, projection screen, etc. This current room doesn't match the home theater description at all. The available directions are east and south. I need to move. Let's choose east. So the action is MOVE: east.</think><answer>MOVE: east\\ \tt </answer>

The current room image shows an art studio with paintings, an artist working, and various art supplies. The target room is a home theater with reclining chairs, projection screen, etc. This art studio is completely different. So the current room is not the target. The available directions are west and east. I need to move. Let's choose west. So the action is MOVE: west. But I need to format it correctly. The question says "reply strictly with - MOVE: chosen direction". So the answer should be "MOVE: west". But let me check the image again.
