        <p>You are the GUIDE in MapWorld, a network of interconnected rooms.<br/><br/>Your role is to assist me in reaching the TARGET ROOM.<br/>You have access to a single image: the TARGET ROOM.<br/>I do not know what this room looks like.<br/>You do not know the map layout or my current location.<br/><br/>At each step, you may only respond in one of the following formats:<br/><br/>1.

        <p>&lt;think&gt;Got it, let&#x27;s look at the image. The TARGET ROOM is a walk-in closet or wardrobe room. It has wooden built-in shelves and cabinets. There are hanging sections with clothes—light blue shirts on the left, then maybe pants or other clothes. The shelves have various storage boxes, baskets, and folded items. There&#x27;s a large arched window on the right with white trim, letting in light. There&#x27;s a bench with a cushioned seat near the window, and some hanging clothes on the right side too. The floor is carpeted, and the overall color scheme is warm with wood tones and soft lighting. So I need to describe that.&lt;/think&gt;&lt;answer&gt;DESCRIPTION: A walk - in closet with wooden built - in storage units. The space has hanging sections with clothes (including light blue shirts on the left and other garments), shelves filled with boxes, baskets, and folded items, a large arched window with white trim on the right allowing natural light, a cushioned bench near the window, and carpeted flooring. The room has an organized layout with various storage options and a cozy atmosphere.&lt;/answer&gt;</p>

If the current room exactly matches the TARGET ROOM based on my description, respond strictly with -<br/>ESCAPE<br/><br/>2. If the current room seems similar but you are uncertain, ask me a clarifying question, reply strictly with -<br/>QUESTION: your question<br/><br/>3.

        <p>&lt;think&gt;Got it, let&#x27;s analyze the current room image. The image shows an office-like space with chairs, a table, doors, and what looks like an office environment. The target room is described as a walk-in closet with wooden storage, hanging clothes, shelves, arched window, etc. This current room doesn&#x27;t match at all. So I need to move in one of the directions. The options are west or east. Let me check the layout. The current room has doors and office furniture, so it&#x27;s not the target. Therefore, I should move. Let&#x27;s pick a direction, maybe west or east. Let&#x27;s say west.&lt;/think&gt;&lt;answer&gt;MOVE: west&lt;/answer&gt;</p>

        <p>Now you made a move to this room, you can choose one of the following three actions:<br/><br/>1.

        <p>&lt;think&gt;Got it, let&#x27;s check the current room. The image shows what looks like a workshop or studio with various equipment, tools, and furniture. The target room is described as a walk-in closet with wooden storage, hanging clothes, shelves, arched window, etc. This current room doesn&#x27;t match the target description at all. So I need to move. The options are west or east. Let me pick a direction. Let&#x27;s say east. Wait, need to check the options. The current room is not the target, so move. Let&#x27;s do MOVE: east.

The action is MOVE: direction. So the response should be &quot;MOVE: west&quot; or similar. Let me confirm the current room. The image is the same office space as before, not the closet. So move.
