The description of the TARGET ROOM is a reception area with a curved brown desk, light green walls, floral sofa, wooden coffee table, tall floor lamp, decorative plants, warm lighting. The current image shows a reception area with a curved desk (but the desk has a different design, maybe more arched glass), white walls, not light green.

Wait, the current room's layout\u2014do we have direction options? The question says \"choose a direction from the available options: ['west', 'east']\". But first, check if the current room is not TARGET. So respond with MOVE: direction. But which direction? Wait, maybe the current room is not matching, so move. But need to pick a direction. Wait, the image shows a reception area, maybe the TARGET is not here. So move. Let's pick west or east. But maybe the current room's features don't match, so move. Let's say MOVE: west (or east, but need to pick one). Wait, the rules say if not TARGET, choose direction. So the action is MOVE: [direction]. Let's check the image again.
