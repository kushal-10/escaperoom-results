	 <think>Got it, let's look at the image. The TARGET ROOM is a reception area, I think. There's a curved reception desk with a person standing there. The room has light green walls, a patterned sofa, a wooden coffee table, a floor lamp, and some plants. Let me describe the elements clearly.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, the layout: a curved reception desk (brownish-red) with a person in a black top. Then, there's a sofa with a floral pattern, a wooden coffee table in front of it, a tall floor lamp with a lampshade, some decorative plants (like a small tree), and the walls are light green with some lighting fixtures.

	 <think>Got it, let's analyze the current room image. The description of the TARGET ROOM is a reception area with a curved brown desk, light green walls, floral sofa, wooden coffee table, tall floor lamp, decorative plants, warm lighting. The current image shows a reception area with a curved desk (but the desk has a different design, maybe more arched glass), white walls, not light green. The elements don't match the TARGET's description. So the current room is not the TARGET. Now, need to choose direction. But wait, the options are west or east. Wait, the current room's layout—do we have direction options? The question says "choose a direction from the available options: ['west', 'east']". But first, check if the current room is not TARGET. So respond with MOVE: direction. But which direction? Wait, maybe the current room is not matching, so move. But need to pick a direction. Wait, the image shows a reception area, maybe the TARGET is not here. So move. Let's pick west or east. But maybe the current room's features don't match, so move. Let's say MOVE: west (or east, but need to pick one). Wait, the rules say if not TARGET, choose direction. So the action is MOVE: [direction]. Let's check the image again. The current room has a reception desk with a person, but the desk is more arched with glass, walls are white, not light green. So not matching. Therefore, move. Let's choose west.</think><answer>MOVE: west</answer>

The current image shows a room with tables, storage units, and what looks like a workshop or storage area—no reception elements like desk, sofa, plants, etc. So this room is definitely not the TARGET.
