        <p>&lt;think&gt;Got it, let&#x27;s look at the image. The TARGET ROOM is a reception area, I think. There&#x27;s a curved reception desk with a person standing there. The room has light green walls, a patterned sofa, a wooden coffee table, a floor lamp, and some plants. Let me describe the elements clearly.<br/><br/>First, the layout: a curved reception desk (brownish-red) with a person in a black top. Then, there&#x27;s a sofa with a floral pattern, a wooden coffee table in front of it, a tall floor lamp with a lampshade, some decorative plants (like a small tree), and the walls are light green with some lighting fixtures. The overall ambiance is warm and welcoming, typical of a hotel or office reception.&lt;/think&gt;&lt;answer&gt;DESCRIPTION: A reception area with a curved, brown reception desk where a person stands. The room has light green walls, a patterned sofa with a floral design, a wooden coffee table in front of the sofa, a tall floor lamp with a lampshade, decorative plants, and warm lighting fixtures. The space has a welcoming, well-lit atmosphere.&lt;/answer&gt;</p>

        <p>You are the SEEKER in MapWorld, a network of interconnected rooms.<br/><br/>Your objective is to find and reach the TARGET ROOM.<br/><br/>I have the image of the TARGET ROOM and will describe it to you.<br/><br/>At each step, you will be shown an image of your current room.<br/><br/>You may perform only one of the following actions:<br/><br/>1. If the current room exactly matches the TARGET ROOM based on my description, respond strictly with -<br/>ESCAPE<br/><br/>2. If the current room seems similar but you are uncertain, ask me a clarifying question, reply strictly with -<br/>QUESTION: your question<br/><br/>3. If the current room is definitely not the TARGET ROOM, choose a direction from the available options: [&#x27;west&#x27;, &#x27;east&#x27;]<br/>reply strictly with -<br/>MOVE: chosen direction<br/><br/>Here is the description of the TARGET ROOM:<br/>description: a reception area with a curved, brown reception desk where a person stands. the room has light green walls, a patterned sofa with a floral design, a wooden coffee table in front of the sofa, a tall floor lamp with a lampshade, decorative plants, and warm lighting fixtures. the space has a welcoming, well-lit atmosphere.<br/>What action do you choose?<br/><br/>You must follow the above format rules exactly.<br/>Do not respond in any other format.

    <div speaker="Player 2 (Explorer) to Game Master" class="msg b-gm" style="">
        <p>&lt;think&gt;Got it, let&#x27;s analyze the current room and the target room description. The target room is a reception area with specific elements like a curved brown desk, light green walls, floral sofa, coffee table, floor lamp, plants, warm lighting. The current room has pink and blue walls, a skylight, and no reception elements. So the current room is definitely not the target. Now, I need to choose a direction. The options are west or east. Let me check the room&#x27;s layout. The current room has a door on the left (west direction maybe?) or other exits. Since the current room doesn&#x27;t match, I need to move. Let&#x27;s pick a direction, maybe west or east. Let&#x27;s say west.&lt;/think&gt;&lt;answer&gt;MOVE: west&lt;/answer&gt;</p>

        <p>Now you made a move to this room, you can choose one of the following three actions:<br/><br/>1. If the current room exactly matches the TARGET ROOM based on my description, respond strictly with -<br/>ESCAPE<br/><br/>2. If the current room seems similar but you are uncertain, ask me a clarifying question, reply strictly with -<br/>QUESTION: your question<br/><br/>3.

        <p>&lt;think&gt;Got it, let&#x27;s check the current room against the target description. The target has a curved brown reception desk, light green walls, floral sofa, coffee table, floor lamp, plants, warm lighting. The current room has a reception desk (curved, wooden), a person standing (the receptionist), light green walls? Wait, the walls here look white, but maybe the description&#x27;s elements. Wait, the current room has a curved reception desk, a person, plants, seating area, warm lighting. Let&#x27;s check each element: curved brown desk? The desk here is wooden with blue accents, but maybe close. Light green walls? The walls are white, but maybe the description&#x27;s &quot;light green&quot; is a bit flexible. Patterned sofa? No, there&#x27;s seating but not floral. But the key is if it matches. Wait, the target has a curved reception desk where a person stands, light green walls, floral sofa, coffee table, tall floor lamp, decorative plants, warm lighting. The current room has a reception desk with a person, plants, seating, but the walls are white, not light green. Wait, but maybe the description&#x27;s &quot;light green&quot; is a general term. Wait, the current room has a reception area with a curved desk, a person, plants, seating, warm lighting. But does it match all elements? The target has a &quot;patterned sofa with a floral design&quot; – the current room doesn&#x27;t have a sofa like that. But maybe the current room is the target. Wait, the image shows a reception area with a curved desk, a person, plants, seating, warm lighting. The walls are white, but maybe the description&#x27;s &quot;light green&quot; is a misremembering, or maybe the image is the target. Wait, the target description says &quot;light green walls&quot; – the current room&#x27;s walls are white, but maybe the image is the target. Wait, let&#x27;s check again. The target has: curved brown reception desk, light green walls, floral sofa, wooden coffee table, tall floor lamp, decorative plants, warm lighting. The current image shows a reception area with a curved desk (brown with blue), a person, plants, seating, warm lighting. The walls are white, but maybe the description&#x27;s &quot;light green&quot; is a typo or the image is the target. Wait, the current room matches the reception area with the desk, person, plants, seating, lighting. So maybe this is the target. Therefore, respond with ESCAPE.&lt;/think&gt;&lt;answer&gt;ESCAPE<br/>&lt;/answer&gt;</p>
