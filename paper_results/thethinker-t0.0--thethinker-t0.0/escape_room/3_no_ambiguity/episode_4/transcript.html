If the current room exactly matches the TARGET ROOM based on my description, respond strictly with -<br/>ESCAPE<br/><br/>2.

        <p>&lt;think&gt;Got it, let&#x27;s analyze the current room image. The current room has two beds with patterned bedspreads, a fan, a chair, and a window with curtains. The description of the TARGET ROOM is a home theater with a projection screen, seating, ceiling projector, etc. This current room doesn&#x27;t match at all. So I need to move in one of the directions. The options are west or east. Since the current room is definitely not the target, I should choose a direction. Let me check the image again. The room has beds, not theater elements. So I&#x27;ll move, maybe west or east. Let&#x27;s pick west.&lt;/think&gt;&lt;answer&gt;MOVE: west&lt;/answer&gt;</p>

The user says &quot;reply strictly with - MOVE: chosen direction&quot;. So the response should be &quot;MOVE: east&quot; (or west, etc.) without extra text. So the final answer is &quot;MOVE: east&quot;.)<br/>Wait, the previous images were the same kitchen and workshop rooms. The TARGET is a home theater, so this kitchen is not it. So move east. So the response is &quot;MOVE: east&quot;.)<br/>[{&#x27;type&#x27;: &#x27;text&#x27;, &#x27;text&#x27;: &quot;MOVE: east&quot;}] (But let me confirm. The current room is a kitchen, which has cabinets, stove, microwave, wooden floorsâ€”no theater elements. So definitely not the target. So move east. So the action is &quot;MOVE: east&quot;.)<br/>Final answer: &quot;MOVE: east&quot; (in the required format).&lt;/think&gt;&lt;answer&gt;MOVE: east<br/>&lt;/answer&gt;</p>

        <p>Now you made a move to this room, you can choose one of the following three actions:<br/><br/>1. If the current room exactly matches the TARGET ROOM based on my description, respond strictly with -<br/>ESCAPE<br/><br/>2. If the current room seems similar but you are uncertain, ask me a clarifying question, reply strictly with -<br/>QUESTION: your question<br/><br/>3. If the current room is definitely not the TARGET ROOM, choose a direction from the available options: [&#x27;west&#x27;, &#x27;east&#x27;]<br/>reply strictly with -<br/>MOVE: chosen direction<br/><br/>What action do you choose?<br/><br/>You must follow the above format rules exactly.<br/>Do not respond in any other format. Do not provide any commentary or clarification.<br/><br/></p>

        <p>&lt;think&gt;Got it, let&#x27;s analyze the current room. The TARGET ROOM is described as a home theater with a projection screen, seating, ceiling projector, etc. This current room has tables, easels, industrial ceiling, metal wallsâ€”no theater elements. Definitely not the target. So need to move. The options are west or east. Let&#x27;s pick west. So respond with MOVE: west.&lt;/think&gt;<br/>MOVE: west<br/>&lt;/answer&gt;</p>
