	 <think>Got it, let's analyze the current room image. The image shows a walk-in closet with clothes, shelves with bags and shoes, and a bench. The target room is a professional audio recording studio control room, which has completely different elements like mixing consoles, soundproofing, monitors, etc. So the current room is definitely not the target. Therefore, I need to choose a direction. But wait, the directions are west or east. Since the current room is a closet, not the studio, I should move. But which direction? Wait, the question is about choosing a direction, but maybe I need to check if there's a way, but since the current room doesn't match, I need to move. But the image doesn't show directions explicitly, but the options are west or east. So I'll pick one, maybe west or east. But the key is that the current room is not the target, so I need to move.</think><answer>MOVE: west\\ \tt </answer>

The target room is a professional audio recording studio control room with mixing consoles, soundproofing, monitors, etc. This bathroom has nothing to do with a studio. So the current room is definitely not the target. The available directions are north or east. So I need to move. Let's choose north or east. Let's say north.
