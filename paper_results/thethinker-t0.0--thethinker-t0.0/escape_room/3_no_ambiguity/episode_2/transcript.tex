	 <think>Got it, let's analyze the current room image. The image shows a room with stairs, a ping pong table, and what looks like a basement or recreational area. The target room is described as a small kitchen with specific features like cabinets, refrigerator, stove, sink, window, etc. The current room doesn't match the kitchen description at all. So I need to move in one of the directions (west or south). Since the current room is not the target, I should choose a direction. Let me check the options. The action should be MOVE: [direction]. Let's pick one, maybe west or south. But first, confirm the current room isn't the target. So the action is MOVE: west (or south, either is fine as long as it's one of the options).</think><answer>MOVE: west</answer>
