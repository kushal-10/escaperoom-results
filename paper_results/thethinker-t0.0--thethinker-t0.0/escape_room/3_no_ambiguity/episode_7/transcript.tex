	 <think>Got it, let's analyze the current room and the target room description. The current room is a bathroom with a toilet, bathtub, tiled walls, etc. The target room is a reception area with wooden paneling, desk, clock, person behind desk, ceiling lights, plants. So the current room is definitely not the target. Therefore, I need to move in one of the directions. But the options are west or east. Since the current room is a bathroom, not a reception area, I should move. But I need to choose a direction. Wait, the action is to move, so I need to pick either west or east. But since the image doesn't show directions, maybe I need to pick one. But let's check the format. The action is MOVE: direction. So I'll choose one direction, maybe west or east. But the current room is a bathroom, so moving would be better. Let's say west.</think><answer>MOVE: west</answer>
