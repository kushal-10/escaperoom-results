There are several armchairs arranged around the room, with a large area rug. The room has beige curtains on one side, a ceiling with fluorescent lights, and a framed picture on the wall. There's also a glass partition leading to another area.

The problem says "choose a direction from the available options: ['west', 'east']" but the image doesn't show exits, but maybe I need to pick a direction. Wait, the current room is a bathroom, so moving west or east—probably need to move. But the key is the current room is not the target, so move. Let's pick a direction, say west. Wait, but the format is MOVE: direction. So the response should be MOVE: west (or east, but need to pick one). Wait, the image is a bathroom, so maybe the target is not here, so move.
