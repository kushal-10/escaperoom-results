        <p>&lt;think&gt;Got it, let&#x27;s look at the image. The TARGET ROOM is a reception or waiting area. Let&#x27;s describe the elements: there&#x27;s a curved reception desk on the left with a flower arrangement. There are several armchairs arranged around the room, with a large area rug. The room has beige curtains on one side, a ceiling with fluorescent lights, and a framed picture on the wall. There&#x27;s also a glass partition leading to another area. The overall style is modern office with neutral colors, furniture, and decorative elements like plants and a rug.&lt;/think&gt;&lt;answer&gt;DESCRIPTION: A modern office reception/waiting area featuring a curved reception desk with a floral arrangement on top, several gray armchairs arranged around the room, a large patterned area rug, beige curtains on one side, a ceiling with fluorescent lighting, a framed artwork on the wall, and a glass partition leading to another space. The room has a neutral color scheme with light walls and carpet.&lt;/answer&gt;</p>

If the current room exactly matches the TARGET ROOM based on my description, respond strictly with -<br/>ESCAPE<br/><br/>2. If the current room seems similar but you are uncertain, ask me a clarifying question, reply strictly with -<br/>QUESTION: your question<br/><br/>3.

        <p>&lt;think&gt;Got it, let&#x27;s analyze the current room image. The image shows a bathroom with a shower, mirror, towel, and a small stuffed toy. The TARGET ROOM is a modern office reception area with desks, armchairs, rugs, etc. So the current room is definitely not the TARGET ROOM. Now, I need to choose a direction, but wait, the options are &#x27;west&#x27; or &#x27;east&#x27;, but the current room is a bathroom, so I need to move. But first, confirm the current room doesn&#x27;t match. So the action is MOVE with a direction. But do I have direction options? The problem says &quot;choose a direction from the available options: [&#x27;west&#x27;, &#x27;east&#x27;]&quot; but the image doesn&#x27;t show exits, but maybe I need to pick a direction. Wait, the current room is a bathroom, so moving west or east—probably need to move. But the key is the current room is not the target, so move. Let&#x27;s pick a direction, say west. Wait, but the format is MOVE: direction. So the response should be MOVE: west (or east, but need to pick one). Wait, the image is a bathroom, so maybe the target is not here, so move. Let&#x27;s do MOVE: west.&lt;/think&gt;&lt;answer&gt;MOVE: west&lt;/answer&gt;</p>
