The target room description is a walk-in closet with wooden storage, hanging clothes, shelves with boxes/baskets, arched window, cushioned bench, carpeted flooring.

Wait, the image shows a bedroom with a bed, so moving west or east. Since the target is a closet, moving towards a closet area. But the current room is not the target, so move. Let's choose west.

The target is a walk-in closet, current room is a bedroom. So not matching. Therefore, move. Let's choose west. So the response is MOVE: west. Wait, no, the options are ['west', 'east'].
