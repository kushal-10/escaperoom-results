If the current room exactly matches the TARGET ROOM based on my description, respond strictly with -<br/>ESCAPE<br/><br/>2. If the current room seems similar but you are uncertain, ask me a clarifying question, reply strictly with -<br/>QUESTION: your question<br/><br/>3.

        <p>&lt;think&gt;Got it, let&#x27;s analyze the current room image. The image shows a locker room with large wooden lockers, benches, and a patterned floor. The target room is described as a music practice room with musical instruments, guitars, drum sets, etc. This current room doesn&#x27;t match at all. So I need to move in one of the directions. The options are west or east. Since the current room is a locker room, not a music practice room, I should move. Let me check the directions. The image shows an exit in the top right, but the directions for movement are west and east. So I&#x27;ll choose one of those.&lt;/think&gt;&lt;answer&gt;MOVE: east&lt;/answer&gt;</p>
