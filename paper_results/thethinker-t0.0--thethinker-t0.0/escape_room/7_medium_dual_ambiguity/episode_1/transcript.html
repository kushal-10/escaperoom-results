Each desk has a laptop on it, and the room has a modern, minimalist design with white walls and flooring. There are large windows or glass panels on one side showing what looks like a stone or brick wall outside. The ceiling has linear lighting fixtures.

The current room does have:<br/>- Rows of desks/chairs<br/>- Computers<br/>- White walls<br/>- Educational posters<br/><br/>But it doesn&#x27;t match the specific elements like laptops, glass panels, green emergency exit sign, etc. Since the current room doesn&#x27;t exactly match the target room description, I need to move in one of the directions (west or south).<br/><br/>Let me check the image again. This room looks very similar to the first image I saw, which I already determined wasn&#x27;t the target room. It still has the same classroom setup with desktop computers, not laptops, and doesn&#x27;t have the glass panels or minimalist design described in the target room.<br/><br/>Since the current room doesn&#x27;t match the target room description, I&#x27;ll choose a direction. Based on the layout, I should move south as that would likely take me closer to finding a room that matches the target description. However, since I&#x27;m back to the same room, I&#x27;ll move south.&lt;/think&gt;&lt;answer&gt;MOVE: south<br/>&lt;/answer&gt;</p>
