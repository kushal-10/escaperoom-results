        <p>&lt;think&gt;Got it, let&#x27;s look at the image. The target room is a walk-in closet. It has various sections: clothes hanging on racks, shelves with shoes, a central cabinet with drawers and glass-fronted upper cabinets, a bench with a blanket, and a large rug. The layout has multiple sections for different clothing storage, with organized hanging spaces, shelves for shoes, and built-in cabinets. So the description should capture the elements like the closet organization, furniture, and storage.&lt;/think&gt;&lt;answer&gt;DESCRIPTION: A spacious walk-in closet featuring multiple sections with hanging clothes, shelves filled with shoes, built-in white cabinets with drawers and glass-fronted upper cabinets, a bench with a blanket, and a large patterned rug covering the floor. The closet has organized storage areas for various clothing items.&lt;/answer&gt;</p>

        <p>You are the SEEKER in MapWorld, a network of interconnected rooms.<br/><br/>Your objective is to find and reach the TARGET ROOM.<br/><br/>I have the image of the TARGET ROOM and will describe it to you.<br/><br/>At each step, you will be shown an image of your current room.<br/><br/>You may perform only one of the following actions:<br/><br/>1. If the current room exactly matches the TARGET ROOM based on my description, respond strictly with -<br/>ESCAPE<br/><br/>2. If the current room seems similar but you are uncertain, ask me a clarifying question, reply strictly with -<br/>QUESTION: your question<br/><br/>3. If the current room is definitely not the TARGET ROOM, choose a direction from the available options: [&#x27;west&#x27;, &#x27;south&#x27;]<br/>reply strictly with -<br/>MOVE: chosen direction<br/><br/>Here is the description of the TARGET ROOM:<br/>description: a spacious walk-in closet featuring multiple sections with hanging clothes, shelves filled with shoes, built-in white cabinets with drawers and glass-fronted upper cabinets, a bench with a blanket, and a large patterned rug covering the floor. the closet has organized storage areas for various clothing items.<br/>What action do you choose?<br/><br/>You must follow the above format rules exactly.<br/>Do not respond in any other format. Do not provide any commentary or clarification.<br/><br/></p>

    <div speaker="Player 2 (Explorer) to Game Master" class="msg b-gm" style="">
        <p>&lt;think&gt;Let me analyze the current room image and compare it with the target room description.<br/><br/>Target room description:<br/>- Spacious walk-in closet<br/>- Multiple sections with hanging clothes<br/>- Shelves filled with shoes<br/>- Built-in white cabinets with drawers and glass-fronted upper cabinets<br/>- Bench with a blanket<br/>- Large patterned rug covering the floor<br/>- Organized storage areas for various clothing items<br/><br/>Current room image:<br/>- This appears to be a closet/wardrobe space<br/>- There are hanging clothes (on the right side)<br/>- There are shelves with various items (on the left side)<br/>- There&#x27;s an ironing board hanging on the wall<br/>- The space seems smaller and less spacious than described<br/>- There don&#x27;t appear to be built-in white cabinets<br/>- There doesn&#x27;t seem to be a bench with a blanket<br/>- There doesn&#x27;t appear to be a large patterned rug<br/>- The storage doesn&#x27;t seem as organized as described<br/><br/>Comparing the current room to the target room, I can see some elements that match (hanging clothes, shelves with items), but many elements don&#x27;t match (no built-in cabinets, no bench, no large rug, not as spacious). The current room appears to be smaller and less organized than the target room description.<br/><br/>Since the current room doesn&#x27;t match the target room description, I should move in one of the available directions (west or south). Based on the layout, I&#x27;d need to explore further to find the target room.&lt;/think&gt;&lt;answer&gt;MOVE: west<br/>&lt;/answer&gt;</p>

Based on the layout, I should continue exploring in one of these directions to find the closet. Since I just came from west, I might try east next, or I could try west again if I think I need to go back.<br/><br/>Let me choose east as the next direction.&lt;/think&gt;&lt;answer&gt;MOVE: east<br/>&lt;/answer&gt;</p>
