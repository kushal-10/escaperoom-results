        <p>&lt;think&gt;Got it, let&#x27;s look at the image. The TARGET ROOM is a music production studio. There&#x27;s a mixing console with multiple monitors, a keyboard, speakers, a drum set, guitars on the wall, a plant, and a leather chair. Let me describe the elements clearly.<br/><br/>First, identify the key features: musical equipment like keyboards, drum set, guitars, audio monitors, mixing console, computer monitors, a plant, a leather couch, and the room layout. So the description should include these elements.<br/><br/>DESCRIPTION: A music production studio with a mixing console, multiple computer monitors, a keyboard, a drum set, two electric guitars mounted on the wall, audio speakers, a potted plant, and a black leather couch. The room has beige walls, a window with a view, and various audio equipment arranged for music creation.&lt;/think&gt;&lt;answer&gt;DESCRIPTION: A music production studio with a mixing console, multiple computer monitors, a keyboard, a drum set, two electric guitars mounted on the wall, audio speakers, a potted plant, and a black leather couch.

        <p>You are the SEEKER in MapWorld, a network of interconnected rooms.<br/><br/>Your objective is to find and reach the TARGET ROOM.<br/><br/>I have the image of the TARGET ROOM and will describe it to you.<br/><br/>At each step, you will be shown an image of your current room.<br/><br/>You may perform only one of the following actions:<br/><br/>1. If the current room exactly matches the TARGET ROOM based on my description, respond strictly with -<br/>ESCAPE<br/><br/>2. If the current room seems similar but you are uncertain, ask me a clarifying question, reply strictly with -<br/>QUESTION: your question<br/><br/>3. If the current room is definitely not the TARGET ROOM, choose a direction from the available options: [&#x27;east&#x27;, &#x27;south&#x27;]<br/>reply strictly with -<br/>MOVE: chosen direction<br/><br/>Here is the description of the TARGET ROOM:<br/>description: a music production studio with a mixing console, multiple computer monitors, a keyboard, a drum set, two electric guitars mounted on the wall, audio speakers, a potted plant, and a black leather couch. the room has beige walls, a window with a view, and various audio equipment arranged for music creation.<br/>What action do you choose?<br/><br/>You must follow the above format rules exactly.<br/>Do not respond in any other format. Do not provide any commentary or clarification.<br/><br/></p>
    </div>

    <div speaker="Player 2 (Explorer) to Game Master" class="msg b-gm" style="">
        <p>&lt;think&gt;Let me analyze the current room image and compare it with the target room description.<br/><br/>Target room description:<br/>- Music production studio<br/>- Mixing console<br/>- Multiple computer monitors<br/>- Keyboard<br/>- Drum set<br/>- Two electric guitars mounted on the wall<br/>- Audio speakers<br/>- Potted plant<br/>- Black leather couch<br/>- Beige walls<br/>- Window with a view<br/>- Various audio equipment arranged for music creation<br/><br/>Current room image:<br/>- I see a mixing console with a person sitting at it<br/>- There are computer monitors<br/>- There are audio speakers<br/>- The walls appear to be gray, not beige<br/>- There&#x27;s no drum set visible<br/>- No electric guitars mounted on the wall<br/>- No potted plant visible<br/>- No black leather couch visible<br/>- No window with a view visible<br/>- The room has a person working at the console, but the description doesn&#x27;t mention people<br/><br/>Comparing the current room to the target room, I can see some elements that match (mixing console, computer monitors, audio speakers) but many elements are missing (drum set, electric guitars, potted plant, black leather couch, window with view, beige walls). The walls are gray in the current image, not beige as described. Also, the current room doesn&#x27;t match the complete description of the target room.<br/><br/>Since the current room doesn&#x27;t exactly match the target room description, I need to move in one of the directions (east or south). Based on the layout, I should move in a direction that might lead me closer to the target room.&lt;/think&gt;&lt;answer&gt;MOVE: east<br/>&lt;/answer&gt;</p>

        <p>Now you made a move to this room, you can choose one of the following three actions:<br/><br/>1. If the current room exactly matches the TARGET ROOM based on my description, respond strictly with -<br/>ESCAPE<br/><br/>2. If the current room seems similar but you are uncertain, ask me a clarifying question, reply strictly with -<br/>QUESTION: your question<br/><br/>3.

        <p>&lt;think&gt;Let me analyze the current room image and compare it with the target room description.<br/><br/>Target room description:<br/>- a music production studio with a mixing console, multiple computer monitors, a keyboard, a drum set, two electric guitars mounted on the wall, audio speakers, a potted plant, and a black leather couch. the room has beige walls, a window with a view, and various audio equipment arranged for music creation.<br/><br/>Current room image:<br/>- This appears to be a bedroom or living area with a large walk-in closet<br/>- There&#x27;s a bed, a couch, a wooden cabinet with a potted plant on top<br/>- The room has beige walls<br/>- There&#x27;s a window with a view<br/>- But there are no music production elements at all - no mixing console, no computer monitors, no keyboard, no drum set, no electric guitars, no audio speakers (other than maybe the speakers on the cabinet which don&#x27;t appear to be audio equipment for music production), no black leather couch (though there is a couch in the room, it&#x27;s not a black leather couch for music production), no audio equipment for music creation.<br/><br/>This current room is definitely not the TARGET ROOM. It&#x27;s a bedroom/closet area with furniture, not a music production studio.<br/><br/>Since I need to choose between &#x27;west&#x27; and &#x27;east&#x27; as directions, I&#x27;ll need to move in one of those directions to find the music production studio. Based on the layout, I should move west to potentially find the music studio.&lt;/answer&gt;</p>
