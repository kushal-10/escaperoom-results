There's a mixing console with multiple monitors, a keyboard, speakers, a drum set, guitars on the wall, a plant, and a leather chair.

So the description should include these elements.\\ \tt \\ \tt DESCRIPTION: A music production studio with a mixing console, multiple computer monitors, a keyboard, a drum set, two electric guitars mounted on the wall, audio speakers, a potted plant, and a black leather couch.
