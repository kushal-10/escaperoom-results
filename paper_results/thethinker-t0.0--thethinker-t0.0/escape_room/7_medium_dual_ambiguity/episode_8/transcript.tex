	 <think>Got it, let's look at the image. The TARGET ROOM is a recording studio, I think. There's a large mixing console with many knobs and sliders. There are speakers on the wall, maybe monitors. The room has wooden flooring, and there are various audio equipment pieces. Let's describe the elements: the mixing console is central, speakers on the wall, other audio gear like amplifiers or processors, windows with curtains, and the overall setup looks like a professional recording studio. So the description should include the main features.</think><answer>DESCRIPTION: A recording studio with a large audio mixing console at the center, surrounded by various audio equipment including speakers mounted on the wall, amplifiers, and other control devices.

	 <think>Got it, let's analyze the current room image. The image shows a hotel lobby or reception area with a reception desk, people in uniforms, decorative elements like large spherical lamps, flowers, and a modern reception setup. The target room is a recording studio with audio equipment, mixing console, etc. The current room is definitely not the target. So I need to move in one of the directions. Since the options are west or east, I'll choose one. But first, confirm it's not the target. So the action should be MOVE with a direction.</think><answer>MOVE: west</answer>

The current image shows a room with audio equipment: mixing console, speakers, guitars, drum set, which matches the recording studio description. So it's the target room. Therefore, respond with ESCAPE.</think><answer>ESCAPE\\ \tt </answer>
