        <p>You are the GUIDE in MapWorld, a network of interconnected rooms.<br/><br/>Your role is to assist me in reaching the TARGET ROOM.<br/>You have access to a single image: the TARGET ROOM.<br/>I do not know what this room looks like.<br/>You do not know the map layout or my current location.<br/><br/>At each step, you may only respond in one of the following formats:<br/><br/>1.

        <p>&lt;think&gt;Got it, let&#x27;s look at the image. The TARGET ROOM is a music production or audio editing room. There&#x27;s a desk with multiple monitors, speakers, a keyboard, audio equipment, and a printer. The setup has two computer monitors, speakers on stands, a keyboard, mixing equipment, and various electronic devices. The room has a carpet with a pattern, and there&#x27;s a poster on the wall. Let me describe the elements clearly.<br/><br/>First, identify the main components: the desk with audio equipment, monitors, speakers, keyboard, and the room&#x27;s appearance. So the description should include the setup, equipment, and room features.&lt;/think&gt;&lt;answer&gt;DESCRIPTION: A music production or audio editing room featuring a multi-tiered desk with two computer monitors (one CRT, one flat-screen), black studio speakers on stands, a keyboard, audio mixing equipment, and various electronic devices. The desk also has a keyboard, mouse, and printer on lower shelves. The room has a patterned carpet, white walls, and a nature-themed poster on one wall.&lt;/answer&gt;</p>
