The description of the target room is a bathroom with double vanity, two sinks, granite countertop, wooden cabinets, light peach walls, tiled backsplash, two rectangular mirrors above sinks, built-in shelf between mirrors, tiled floor, and bathtub area. The current image shows a bathroom with a pedestal sink, tiled walls, bathtub, towel rack, but does it match the target? Let's check: the target has double vanity (two sinks), this has one pedestal sink. The walls here are yellowish, not light peach. The backsplash is tiled, but the target has a double vanity with two sinks. Wait, the current room has a pedestal sink (single sink), while the target has double vanity (two sinks). Also, the target has wooden cabinets with drawers/doors, which this image doesn't show. The mirrors above sinks: the current image has a mirror area but not two rectangular mirrors above sinks. The built-in shelf between mirrors\u2014this image doesn't show that. The floor is tiled, but the target's floor is tiled too. The bathtub area is visible on the right, but the target's bathtub area is on the right. Hmm, but the current room has a pedestal sink, not double vanity. So is it a match? No, because the target has double vanity with two sinks, this has one. So the current room is not the target. Wait, but let's check again. The current image shows a bathroom with a pedestal sink, tiled walls, bathtub, towel rack. The target has double vanity (two sinks), granite countertop, wooden cabinets, light peach walls, tiled backsplash, two rectangular mirrors above sinks, built-in shelf between mirrors, tiled floor, bathtub area. The current room doesn't have double vanity, so it's not the target. Therefore, I need to move. The available directions are north or east. Let's choose north or east. Let's say north. Wait, the action format says \"choose a direction from the available options: ['north', 'east']\" so I need to pick one. Let's do MOVE: north. Wait, but let me check the image again. The current image is a bathroom with a pedestal sink, which doesn't match the target's double vanity. So the current room is not the target, so move.
