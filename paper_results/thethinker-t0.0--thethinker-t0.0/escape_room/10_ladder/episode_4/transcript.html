        <p>&lt;think&gt;I&#x27;m looking at the image provided, which shows what appears to be a home theater or media room. Let me describe the TARGET ROOM as requested:<br/><br/>The image shows a dimly lit room with a home theater setup. There are several beige/cream-colored reclining chairs arranged in a row facing a large projection screen. The screen is displaying what appears to be a sports event or game, with a crowd visible. The room has a sloped ceiling with recessed lighting fixtures. The floor is carpeted in a warm brown/beige tone. The walls appear to be dark brown or maroon, creating a dark environment ideal for viewing a screen. There&#x27;s a projector mounted near the ceiling, and the room has a cozy, intimate feel with the seating arrangement. There appear to be some built-in shelves or cabinets on one wall.<br/><br/>I&#x27;ll provide this description in the requested format.&lt;/think&gt;&lt;answer&gt;DESCRIPTION: A dimly lit home theater room with a sloped ceiling. The room features five beige reclining chairs arranged in a row facing a large projection screen displaying what appears to be a sports event with a crowd. The floor is carpeted in a warm brown tone, and the walls are dark brown/maroon. Recessed ceiling lights illuminate the space, with a projector mounted near the ceiling. The room has a cozy, intimate atmosphere designed for viewing media with minimal ambient light. There appear to be built-in shelves or cabinets on one wall.&lt;/answer&gt;</p>

        <p>You are the SEEKER in MapWorld, a network of interconnected rooms.<br/><br/>Your objective is to find and reach the TARGET ROOM.<br/><br/>I have the image of the TARGET ROOM and will describe it to you.<br/><br/>At each step, you will be shown an image of your current room.<br/><br/>You may perform only one of the following actions:<br/><br/>1. If the current room exactly matches the TARGET ROOM based on my description, respond strictly with -<br/>ESCAPE<br/><br/>2. If the current room seems similar but you are uncertain, ask me a clarifying question, reply strictly with -<br/>QUESTION: your question<br/><br/>3. If the current room is definitely not the TARGET ROOM, choose a direction from the available options: [&#x27;west&#x27;, &#x27;north&#x27;, &#x27;east&#x27;]<br/>reply strictly with -<br/>MOVE: chosen direction<br/><br/>Here is the description of the TARGET ROOM:<br/>description: a dimly lit home theater room with a sloped ceiling. the room features five beige reclining chairs arranged in a row facing a large projection screen displaying what appears to be a sports event with a crowd. the floor is carpeted in a warm brown tone, and the walls are dark brown/maroon. recessed ceiling lights illuminate the space, with a projector mounted near the ceiling. the room has a cozy, intimate atmosphere designed for viewing media with minimal ambient light. there appear to be built-in shelves or cabinets on one wall.<br/>What action do you choose?<br/><br/>You must follow the above format rules exactly.<br/>Do not respond in any other format.

    <div speaker="Player 2 (Explorer) to Game Master" class="msg b-gm" style="">
        <p>&lt;think&gt;Got it, let&#x27;s analyze the current room image. The current room shows a bedroom with a bed, a window with curtains, a lamp, and furniture like a chair and ottoman. The target room is described as a home theater with reclining chairs, a projection screen, sloped ceiling, etc. This current room doesn&#x27;t match at all. So I need to move in one of the directions. Since the options are west, north, east, I should choose one. But first, confirm it&#x27;s not the target. So the action would be MOVE with a direction.&lt;/think&gt;&lt;answer&gt;MOVE: north<br/>&lt;/answer&gt;</p>
