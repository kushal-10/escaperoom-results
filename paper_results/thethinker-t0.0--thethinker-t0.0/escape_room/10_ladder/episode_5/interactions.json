The current image shows two beds with patterned bedspreads (floral-like), lamps, nightstand (which could be part of the small table area), light-colored walls. Wait, do we have floral curtains? The image doesn't show curtains, but maybe the view of stone building? Wait, the current image has two beds, patterned bedspreads, lamps, nightstand. Let's check if it matches. The target has two double beds, patterned bedspreads, white pillows (though these pillows might be similar), lamps, small round table (nightstand could be part), light walls, neutral carpet. The current room has two beds, patterned bedspreads, lamps, nightstand, light walls. Even though curtains and view of stone building might not be visible, but the main elements like two beds, patterned bedspreads, lamps, etc., seem to match. So this is the target room.
