        <p>&lt;think&gt;I&#x27;m looking at an image of what appears to be a reception or information desk area for The University of Vermont. Let me describe the TARGET ROOM as shown in the image:<br/><br/>The image shows a reception area with &quot;The University of Vermont&quot; written prominently at the top. The room has a light, warm color scheme with beige walls and wooden elements. There&#x27;s a reception desk with a light wood finish. On the desk, I can see what appears to be a computer monitor, some papers, and possibly a phone. There&#x27;s a decorative lamp on the left side of the desk area. <br/><br/>On the wall behind the desk, there&#x27;s a framed picture or artwork showing what looks like a tower or bell tower, which appears to be a university landmark. There&#x27;s a door visible on the left side of the image, and the overall lighting is warm and welcoming. The desk has a counter with what appears to be informational materials or brochures. There are also some small displays or stands with what might be brochures or information materials.<br/><br/>This appears to be a university reception or information center, likely the front desk or welcome area for visitors to The University of Vermont.&lt;/think&gt;&lt;answer&gt;DESCRIPTION: This is a reception area for The University of Vermont. The room features a light wood reception desk with a counter area. Above the desk, &quot;The University of Vermont&quot; is prominently displayed. The walls are painted in a warm beige tone. There&#x27;s a framed artwork of what appears to be a tower or bell tower on the wall behind the desk. The desk has a computer monitor, papers, and what looks like a phone. A decorative yellow lamp sits on the left side of the desk area. There&#x27;s a wooden door visible on the left side of the room, and the overall lighting creates a warm, welcoming atmosphere. The desk counter has informational materials and small display stands with brochures or information. The room has a professional yet inviting appearance typical of a university welcome center.&lt;/answer&gt;</p>

        <p>&lt;think&gt;Got it, let&#x27;s analyze the current room image. The image shows a room with stairs on the left, a plain wall, some furniture like a covered item and a lamp, but it doesn&#x27;t match the target room description at all. The target is a university reception area with a desk, specific decor, etc. So the current room is definitely not the target. Now, I need to choose a direction. But wait, the options are west or east. Let me check the room&#x27;s layout. The current room doesn&#x27;t have clear directions shown, but since it&#x27;s not the target, I need to move. But maybe the image doesn&#x27;t show exits clearly. Wait, the current room has stairs, walls, but no reception desk. So I need to move. Let&#x27;s pick a direction. Since the image doesn&#x27;t show obvious exits, but the rules say choose west or east. Let&#x27;s say west.&lt;/think&gt;&lt;answer&gt;MOVE: west&lt;/answer&gt;</p>

        <p>&lt;think&gt;Got it, let&#x27;s check the current room. The image shows a classroom with sewing machines, kids, desks—this is definitely not the university reception area described. The target is a reception desk, warm beige walls, etc. So the current room is not the target. The options now are east or south. So I need to move. Let&#x27;s choose east.

The target has a desk, specific decor, etc. So the current room is not the target. The options are west or east. Since I was previously moving west, maybe try east? Wait, the image is the same as the first one. So I need to move. Let&#x27;s choose west (or east, but since it&#x27;s the same, maybe west again). So reply with MOVE: west.&lt;/think&gt;&lt;answer&gt;MOVE: west<br/>})] (Wait, need to make sure the format is right. The action is MOVE: direction. So final answer is MOVE: west.
