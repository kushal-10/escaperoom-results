	 <think>I'm looking at an image of what appears to be a reception or information desk area for The University of Vermont. Let me describe the TARGET ROOM as shown in the image:\\ \tt \\ \tt The image shows a reception area with "The University of Vermont" written prominently at the top. The room has a light, warm color scheme with beige walls and wooden elements. There's a reception desk with a light wood finish. On the desk, I can see what appears to be a computer monitor, some papers, and possibly a phone. There's a decorative lamp on the left side of the desk area. \\ \tt \\ \tt On the wall behind the desk, there's a framed picture or artwork showing what looks like a tower or bell tower, which appears to be a university landmark. There's a door visible on the left side of the image, and the overall lighting is warm and welcoming. The desk has a counter with what appears to be informational materials or brochures. There are also some small displays or stands with what might be brochures or information materials.\\ \tt \\ \tt This appears to be a university reception or information center, likely the front desk or welcome area for visitors to The University of Vermont.</think><answer>DESCRIPTION: This is a reception area for The University of Vermont.

	 <think>Got it, let's analyze the current room image. The image shows a room with stairs on the left, a plain wall, some furniture like a covered item and a lamp, but it doesn't match the target room description at all. The target is a university reception area with a desk, specific decor, etc. So the current room is definitely not the target. Now, I need to choose a direction. But wait, the options are west or east. Let me check the room's layout. The current room doesn't have clear directions shown, but since it's not the target, I need to move. But maybe the image doesn't show exits clearly. Wait, the current room has stairs, walls, but no reception desk. So I need to move. Let's pick a direction.
