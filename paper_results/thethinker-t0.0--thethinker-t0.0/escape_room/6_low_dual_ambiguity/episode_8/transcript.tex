There's a large mixing console with numerous sliders, buttons, and knobs. A person is sitting in a red chair at the console, working with what appears to be a piece of paper or script. \\ \tt \\ \tt The room has soundproofing with gray acoustic wall panels. There are several studio monitors (speakers) on wooden surfaces, including black speakers with visible woofers and tweeters. There are also computer monitors visible on the console. The room has a professional audio equipment rack with various processors and amplifiers. There's a framed poster or artwork on the wall with some text and colorful imagery. The overall environment suggests this is a professional audio production or recording studio.\\ \tt \\ \tt I'll provide this description in the requested format.</think><answer>DESCRIPTION: This is a professional audio recording studio control room.

	 <think>Got it, let's analyze the current room image. The image shows a reception area with a curved desk, wooden cabinets, and tiled flooring. This doesn't match the audio studio description at all. The target room is a professional audio studio with mixing consoles, soundproofing, speakers, etc. So the current room is definitely not the target. I need to choose a direction, but the options are west or east. Since the image doesn't show exits clearly, but the task is to move, so I'll pick a direction. Let me check the format: MOVE: direction. So I'll choose west or east, maybe west first.</think><answer>MOVE: west</answer>
