Therefore, move. Let's choose west. Wait, the options are west or east. Let's pick west. So reply with MOVE: west. Wait, but maybe I made a mistake. Let me confirm. The target is a reading room with bookshelves, armchairs, etc. Current room is a bedroom with a bed, so not matching. Therefore, move. So the action is MOVE: west (or east, either is fine as long as not matching). Let's do MOVE: west. Wait, but maybe the image's direction. Wait, the current room's layout—maybe west is the direction.
