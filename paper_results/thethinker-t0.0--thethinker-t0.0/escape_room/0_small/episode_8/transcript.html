        <p>You are the GUIDE in MapWorld, a network of interconnected rooms.<br/><br/>Your role is to assist me in reaching the TARGET ROOM.<br/>You have access to a single image: the TARGET ROOM.<br/>I do not know what this room looks like.<br/>You do not know the map layout or my current location.<br/><br/>At each step, you may only respond in one of the following formats:<br/><br/>1.

        <p>&lt;think&gt;Got it, let&#x27;s look at the image. The TARGET ROOM is a cluttered workspace with various items. There&#x27;s a desk with a laptop, an old CRT monitor, shelves with books and photos, a lamp, a chair, and lots of papers and electronics. Let me describe the key elements.<br/><br/>First, the desk area has a glass desk with a laptop, a can of Dust-Off, a can of soda, and various office supplies. There&#x27;s an old CRT monitor, speakers, and shelves above with books, framed photos, and other items. The walls have framed pictures and certificates. There&#x27;s a chair with a cushion, and the room has shelves with papers, books, and other clutter. The lighting includes a black desk lamp. So the description should capture the cluttered, workspace nature with various tech and personal items.&lt;/think&gt;&lt;answer&gt;DESCRIPTION: A cluttered workspace with a glass desk holding a laptop, an old CRT monitor, and various office supplies. Shelves above contain books, framed photographs, and other items. The walls have framed pictures and certificates. A cushioned chair sits near the desk, and the room has shelves filled with papers, books, and electronic devices. A black desk lamp provides lighting, and the space contains numerous personal and work-related items.&lt;/answer&gt;</p>

        <p>You are the SEEKER in MapWorld, a network of interconnected rooms.<br/><br/>Your objective is to find and reach the TARGET ROOM.<br/><br/>I have the image of the TARGET ROOM and will describe it to you.<br/><br/>At each step, you will be shown an image of your current room.<br/><br/>You may perform only one of the following actions:<br/><br/>1. If the current room exactly matches the TARGET ROOM based on my description, respond strictly with -<br/>ESCAPE<br/><br/>2. If the current room seems similar but you are uncertain, ask me a clarifying question, reply strictly with -<br/>QUESTION: your question<br/><br/>3. If the current room is definitely not the TARGET ROOM, choose a direction from the available options: [&#x27;north&#x27;, &#x27;east&#x27;]<br/>reply strictly with -<br/>MOVE: chosen direction<br/><br/>Here is the description of the TARGET ROOM:<br/>description: a cluttered workspace with a glass desk holding a laptop, an old crt monitor, and various office supplies. shelves above contain books, framed photographs, and other items. the walls have framed pictures and certificates. a cushioned chair sits near the desk, and the room has shelves filled with papers, books, and electronic devices. a black desk lamp provides lighting, and the space contains numerous personal and work-related items.<br/>What action do you choose?<br/><br/>You must follow the above format rules exactly.<br/>Do not respond in any other format. Do not provide any commentary or clarification.<br/><br/></p>
    </div>

    <div speaker="Player 2 (Explorer) to Game Master" class="msg b-gm" style="">
        <p>&lt;think&gt;Let me analyze the current room image and compare it with the target room description.<br/><br/>Target room description:<br/>- Cluttered workspace<br/>- Glass desk with laptop, old CRT monitor, office supplies<br/>- Shelves above with books, framed photographs, other items<br/>- Walls with framed pictures and certificates<br/>- Cushioned chair near desk<br/>- Shelves filled with papers, books, electronic devices<br/>- Black desk lamp<br/>- Numerous personal and work-related items<br/><br/>Current room image:<br/>- I see a desk with two modern flat-screen monitors (not CRT)<br/>- The desk appears to be wooden, not glass<br/>- There are office supplies visible (pens, etc.)<br/>- There&#x27;s a framed picture on the wall<br/>- There&#x27;s a whiteboard with writing<br/>- There&#x27;s a chair visible<br/>- There are speakers and other electronic devices<br/>- There&#x27;s a mug on the desk<br/>- There don&#x27;t appear to be shelves with books and items above the desk<br/>- There doesn&#x27;t seem to be a black desk lamp visible<br/><br/>Comparing the current room to the target room description, I can see some similarities (office workspace, desk with computers, chair, office supplies) but there are also differences. The current room has modern flat-screen monitors rather than an old CRT monitor and glass desk, and it lacks the specific elements mentioned in the target description like shelves with books and framed photographs above the desk, the specific arrangement of items, and the black desk lamp.<br/><br/>Since the current room doesn&#x27;t exactly match the target room description, I need to determine if I should move or ask a question. Given that I can see some elements but not all, and there are clear differences, I should ask for clarification rather than move yet, as I&#x27;m not certain if this is the target room or if I need to look for specific elements that match the description.&lt;/think&gt;&lt;answer&gt;MOVE: north<br/>&lt;/answer&gt;</p>

The options given are &#x27;east&#x27; and &#x27;south&#x27; (though I only see one direction clearly visible in the image which appears to be east or south based on the layout).<br/><br/>Given that this is definitely not the target room, I should move in a direction. Since I can see the kitchen area and there&#x27;s no indication of the target office workspace nearby in this direction, I&#x27;ll choose a direction. Based on the layout, moving east would be appropriate.&lt;/think&gt;&lt;answer&gt;MOVE: east<br/>&lt;/answer&gt;</p>
