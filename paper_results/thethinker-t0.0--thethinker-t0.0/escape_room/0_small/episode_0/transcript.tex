	 <think>Got it, let's look at the image. The TARGET ROOM is a modern lobby or reception area. There's a wooden reception desk with a curved design, two people standing near it—one in a uniform maybe, another in casual clothes. The room has large wooden columns, a polished floor, recessed lighting, and a contemporary design with glass and wood elements. There's a seating area with chairs and a plant, and the overall atmosphere is professional and welcoming. So the description should capture the key elements: layout, furniture, design style.</think><answer>DESCRIPTION: A modern reception area with a curved wooden front desk, polished flooring, tall wooden columns, recessed ceiling lights, and contemporary design elements.
