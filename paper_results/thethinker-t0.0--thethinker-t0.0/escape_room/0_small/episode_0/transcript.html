        <p>You are the GUIDE in MapWorld, a network of interconnected rooms.<br/><br/>Your role is to assist me in reaching the TARGET ROOM.<br/>You have access to a single image: the TARGET ROOM.<br/>I do not know what this room looks like.<br/>You do not know the map layout or my current location.<br/><br/>At each step, you may only respond in one of the following formats:<br/><br/>1. If I ask a question about the TARGET ROOM, reply strictly as:<br/>ANSWER: your answer<br/><br/>2. If I request a description of the TARGET ROOM, reply strictly as:<br/>DESCRIPTION: your description of the image<br/><br/>Do not respond in any other format.

        <p>&lt;think&gt;Got it, let&#x27;s look at the image. The TARGET ROOM is a modern lobby or reception area. There&#x27;s a wooden reception desk with a curved design, two people standing near it—one in a uniform maybe, another in casual clothes. The room has large wooden columns, a polished floor, recessed lighting, and a contemporary design with glass and wood elements. There&#x27;s a seating area with chairs and a plant, and the overall atmosphere is professional and welcoming. So the description should capture the key elements: layout, furniture, design style.&lt;/think&gt;&lt;answer&gt;DESCRIPTION: A modern reception area with a curved wooden front desk, polished flooring, tall wooden columns, recessed ceiling lights, and contemporary design elements. There are two people near the desk, and the space includes seating with chairs and a plant, creating a professional and welcoming atmosphere.&lt;/answer&gt;</p>

        <p>You are the SEEKER in MapWorld, a network of interconnected rooms.<br/><br/>Your objective is to find and reach the TARGET ROOM.<br/><br/>I have the image of the TARGET ROOM and will describe it to you.<br/><br/>At each step, you will be shown an image of your current room.<br/><br/>You may perform only one of the following actions:<br/><br/>1. If the current room exactly matches the TARGET ROOM based on my description, respond strictly with -<br/>ESCAPE<br/><br/>2. If the current room seems similar but you are uncertain, ask me a clarifying question, reply strictly with -<br/>QUESTION: your question<br/><br/>3. If the current room is definitely not the TARGET ROOM, choose a direction from the available options: [&#x27;east&#x27;, &#x27;south&#x27;]<br/>reply strictly with -<br/>MOVE: chosen direction<br/><br/>Here is the description of the TARGET ROOM:<br/>description: a modern reception area with a curved wooden front desk, polished flooring, tall wooden columns, recessed ceiling lights, and contemporary design elements. there are two people near the desk, and the space includes seating with chairs and a plant, creating a professional and welcoming atmosphere.<br/>What action do you choose?<br/><br/>You must follow the above format rules exactly.<br/>Do not respond in any other format.

    <div speaker="Player 2 (Explorer) to Game Master" class="msg b-gm" style="">
        <p>&lt;think&gt;Got it, let&#x27;s analyze the current room image. The current room has rows of computer desks with old monitors, chairs, and a window with blinds. The description of the target room is a modern reception area with a curved wooden front desk, polished flooring, tall wooden columns, recessed ceiling lights, etc. This current room doesn&#x27;t match at all. So I need to move in one of the directions. The options are east or south. Since the current room is a computer lab-like space, not a reception area, I should move. Let&#x27;s choose a direction, maybe south or east. But the action should be MOVE: direction.&lt;/think&gt;&lt;answer&gt;MOVE: south&lt;/answer&gt;</p>

        <p>Now you made a move to this room, you can choose one of the following three actions:<br/><br/>1. If the current room exactly matches the TARGET ROOM based on my description, respond strictly with -<br/>ESCAPE<br/><br/>2.

        <p>&lt;think&gt;Got it, let&#x27;s check the current room. The target room is a modern reception area with a curved wooden desk, polished flooring, columns, etc. This current room has lockers or changing rooms with chairs, which doesn&#x27;t match the reception area description. So it&#x27;s definitely not the target room. The available directions are north and east. I need to move. Let&#x27;s choose north or east. Let&#x27;s say north. Then the action would be MOVE: north. But let me confirm. The current room is locker rooms, not reception. So move.&lt;/think&gt;&lt;answer&gt;MOVE: north<br/>&lt;/answer&gt;</p>

The target is a modern reception area with a curved wooden front desk, polished flooring, tall wooden columns, recessed ceiling lights, seating with chairs and a plant, professional and welcoming. The current room has a curved wooden front desk (matches), polished flooring (matches), a plant (matches), seating area (implied by the desk setup), and contemporary design. Also, there&#x27;s a plant, seating, and the wooden desk. So this matches the target room description. Therefore, respond with ESCAPE.&lt;/think&gt;&lt;answer&gt;ESCAPE<br/>&lt;/answer&gt;</p>
