However, it's quite similar to the target room description.\n\nSince the current room has many elements matching the target room description but I'm not completely certain if it's exactly the target room, I should ask for clarification rather than move or escape. However, the question asks me to choose between moving or asking a question. Given the similarity, I'll ask a clarifying question about the windows and door artwork.\n\nWait, let me re-read the instructions. The options are:\n1. If it exactly matches, ESCAPE\n2. If it seems similar but uncertain, QUESTION\n3. If definitely not, choose direction\n\nThe current room has wooden tables, chairs, bookshelves, carpeted floor, and is well-lit. It's quite similar but not exactly matching the description (windows on left instead of right, no door with artwork visible). But it's close enough that I might be uncertain if it's exactly the target room.\n\nGiven the similarity, I'll ask a clarifying question about the windows and door artwork. However, the format requires me to choose between QUESTION or MOVE. Since I'm uncertain if it's exactly the target room, I'll ask a question.\nBut wait, the options for the second action are to ask a question, and the format is \"QUESTION: your question\". But the question says \"choose one of the following three actions\" and then lists them. I need to choose between ESCAPE, QUESTION, or MOVE.\n\nLet me re-analyze. The current room has:\n- Wooden tables (matches)\n- Wooden chairs (matches)\n- Bookshelves (matches)\n- Carpeted floor (matches)\n- Well-lit (matches)\n- But windows on left (not right), no door with artwork\n\nSince it's quite similar but not exactly matching, and I'm uncertain if it's exactly the target room, I should ask a clarifying question.\n\nHowever, the question specifically says \"choose one of the following three actions\" and then lists them. I need to choose between ESCAPE, QUESTION, or MOVE.\n\nGiven that the room is similar but not exactly matching, and I'm uncertain, I'll ask a clarifying question.\nBut wait, the image shows a library-like room with large windows on the left, wooden tables, chairs, bookshelves, carpeted floor. It's quite close to the target description, but not exactly. I'm uncertain if it's exactly the target room, so I should ask a question.\n\nBut the format requires me to use \"QUESTION: your question\" if I'm uncertain. However, the question says \"choose one of the following three actions\" and then lists them. I need to choose between ESCAPE, QUESTION, or MOVE.\n\nLet me check if it's exactly the target room. The target has \"large windows on the right side\" but this has them on the left. The target has \"a door with artwork in the background\" but this doesn't show a door with artwork. So it's not exactly the target room.\n\nTherefore, I should choose a direction. But the options are ['west', 'south'].\n\nLet me look at the image again. The room has large windows on the left, wooden tables, chairs, bookshelves, carpeted floor. It's a library or study room. The layout suggests I should move south or west.\n\nGiven the layout, I'll move south.\nBut wait, the question says \"choose a direction from the available options: ['west', 'south']\" for the third action. So I need to choose between west or south.\n\nLet me analyze the room layout. The room appears to be a library with tables facing the windows. If I",
