	 <think>I'm looking at the image provided, which shows what appears to be a TARGET ROOM. Let me describe it based on what I see:\\ \tt \\ \tt The image shows what appears to be a small room with a retro or vintage style. The room has:\\ \tt - Wooden paneling on the walls (both upper and lower sections)\\ \tt - A curved red counter/bar area with a white countertop\\ \tt - Several metal bar stools with round seats\\ \tt - A checkered floor pattern with black and white tiles\\ \tt - Some windows or window openings with wooden trim\\ \tt - What appears to be a ceiling fan or light fixture\\ \tt - Some shelving or storage areas\\ \tt \\ \tt The room has a somewhat dated, possibly abandoned or unused appearance with the wooden paneling and checkered floor pattern suggesting it might be a vintage diner, bar, or similar establishment.\\ \tt \\ \tt I'll provide this description in the requested format.</think><answer>DESCRIPTION: This is a small room with vintage diner-style decor. It features a curved red counter/bar with a white countertop, accompanied by four metal bar stools with round seats. The walls have wooden paneling with a scalloped valance at the top, and there are windows with wooden trim. The floor has a distinctive black and white checkered pattern with square tiles. The ceiling has a simple design with what appears to be a ceiling fan or light fixture. The room has an aged appearance with some signs of wear, suggesting it might be an old diner or bar space.</answer>

	 <think>Got it, let's analyze the current room image. The current room has two beds, a dresser, lamps, and a window with blinds. The target room is described as a small diner-style room with a red counter, bar stools, wooden paneling, checkered floor, etc. This current room doesn't match at all. So I need to move in one of the directions (west or south). Since the question is about choosing a direction, I'll pick one. Let's say I move west.</think><answer>MOVE: west</answer>
