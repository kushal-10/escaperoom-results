	 <think>Got it, let's look at the image. The TARGET ROOM has a wooden desk with a laptop (Acer), a fax machine, two lamps with stained glass shades, a phone, and framed floral artwork on the wall. The wall is brown, and there are four framed pictures with flowers. The desk is dark red wood, and there's a chair partially visible.
