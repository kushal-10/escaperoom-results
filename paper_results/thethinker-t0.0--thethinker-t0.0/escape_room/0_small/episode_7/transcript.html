        <p>&lt;think&gt;I&#x27;m looking at the image of the TARGET ROOM, which appears to be a walk-in closet or master bedroom closet. Let me describe it:<br/><br/>The TARGET ROOM is a spacious walk-in closet with wooden cabinetry and shelving units. It has a warm, wooden interior with built-in storage systems. The room has:<br/>- Multiple sections with hanging clothes on wooden hangers<br/>- Various clothing items organized by color and type<br/>- Built-in wooden cabinets with shelves for folded items<br/>- A central wooden island or desk with drawers<br/>- A patterned bench or stool in the center<br/>- A large area rug on the floor<br/>- Skylights in the ceiling letting in natural light<br/>- The walls and ceiling have a warm, yellowish tone<br/>- The overall design is elegant and organized, with a traditional wooden aesthetic<br/><br/>I&#x27;ll provide this description in the required format.&lt;/think&gt;&lt;answer&gt;DESCRIPTION: This is a spacious walk-in closet with extensive wooden cabinetry and shelving units.

        <p>You are the SEEKER in MapWorld, a network of interconnected rooms.<br/><br/>Your objective is to find and reach the TARGET ROOM.<br/><br/>I have the image of the TARGET ROOM and will describe it to you.<br/><br/>At each step, you will be shown an image of your current room.<br/><br/>You may perform only one of the following actions:<br/><br/>1. If the current room exactly matches the TARGET ROOM based on my description, respond strictly with -<br/>ESCAPE<br/><br/>2. If the current room seems similar but you are uncertain, ask me a clarifying question, reply strictly with -<br/>QUESTION: your question<br/><br/>3. If the current room is definitely not the TARGET ROOM, choose a direction from the available options: [&#x27;west&#x27;, &#x27;south&#x27;]<br/>reply strictly with -<br/>MOVE: chosen direction<br/><br/>Here is the description of the TARGET ROOM:<br/>description: this is a spacious walk-in closet with extensive wooden cabinetry and shelving units. the room features multiple sections with hanging clothes organized by color, built-in wooden cabinets with shelves for folded items, and a central wooden island with drawers. there&#x27;s a patterned bench/stool in the center area, and the floor has a large area rug. the ceiling has skylights providing natural light, and the walls and ceiling have a warm yellowish tone. the closet has a traditional wooden aesthetic with various clothing items neatly arranged throughout the space.<br/>What action do you choose?<br/><br/>You must follow the above format rules exactly.<br/>Do not respond in any other format.

    <div speaker="Player 2 (Explorer) to Game Master" class="msg b-gm" style="">
        <p>&lt;think&gt;Got it, let&#x27;s analyze the current room and the target room description. The target is a spacious walk-in closet with wooden cabinets, shelving, hanging clothes, etc. The current room shows what looks like a utility or basement area with concrete blocks, a water heater, tiled walls—definitely not a closet. So the current room is not the target. The available directions are west and south. I need to choose one. Let me check the image again. The room has industrial elements, not closet features. So I should move in one of the directions. Let&#x27;s pick west or south. Let&#x27;s go with west.&lt;/think&gt;&lt;answer&gt;MOVE: west&lt;/answer&gt;</p>

        <p>Now you made a move to this room, you can choose one of the following three actions:<br/><br/>1. If the current room exactly matches the TARGET ROOM based on my description, respond strictly with -<br/>ESCAPE<br/><br/>2. If the current room seems similar but you are uncertain, ask me a clarifying question, reply strictly with -<br/>QUESTION: your question<br/><br/>3.

        <p>&lt;think&gt;Got it, let&#x27;s check the current room against the target description. The target is a walk-in closet with wooden cabinets, shelving, hanging clothes, etc. The current room is a living room with sofas, a piano, fireplace—definitely not a closet. So it&#x27;s not the target. Available directions are east and south. Need to move. Let&#x27;s pick one. Let&#x27;s say south. Wait, the options are [&#x27;east&#x27;, &#x27;south&#x27;], so I can choose either. Let&#x27;s go with south. But wait, the action format is MOVE: direction. So the response should be MOVE: south (or east). Let me confirm the current room isn&#x27;t the target. The living room has no closet elements. So move.&lt;/think&gt;&lt;answer&gt;MOVE: south<br/>&lt;/answer&gt;</p>
