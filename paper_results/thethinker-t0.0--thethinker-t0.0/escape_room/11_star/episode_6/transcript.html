        <p>&lt;think&gt;Got it, let&#x27;s look at the image. The TARGET ROOM is a cozy attic bedroom with slanted ceilings. There&#x27;s a skylight window letting in natural light. The room has a low bed with a striped cover, black pillows, and stuffed animals like a panda and a rabbit. There are built-in shelves with books and electronics, a small nightstand with a lamp, and framed pictures on the walls. The overall color scheme is neutral with white walls and carpet, creating a warm, inviting space.

        <p>&lt;think&gt;Got it, let&#x27;s analyze the current room image. The image shows a 7-Eleven convenience store, which is completely different from the target room description (a cozy attic bedroom). So the current room is not the target. The options are east or south. I need to choose a direction. Let me check the image again—this is definitely not the attic bedroom. So I should move in one of the directions. Let&#x27;s pick one, maybe south or east. But the action should be MOVE: direction.&lt;/think&gt;&lt;answer&gt;MOVE: south<br/>&lt;/answer&gt;</p>

The target room is a cozy attic bedroom with slanted ceilings, skylight, bed, stuffed animals, shelves, nightstand, etc. The current room is an office with a desk, shelves, chair, but no slanted ceilings, bed, stuffed animals, skylight, etc. So it&#x27;s not the target.

Wait, the current action&#x27;s direction options are [&#x27;north&#x27;]? Let me check. The current room is not the target, so I need to move. The direction options given here are [&#x27;north&#x27;], so I should move north. So the action is MOVE: north. Wait, let me confirm the current room. The image shows an office with a desk, shelves, chair, but no elements of the target room (bed, skylight, stuffed animals, etc.). So definitely not the target.

If the current room seems similar but you are uncertain, ask me a clarifying question, reply strictly with -<br/>QUESTION: your question<br/><br/>3. If the current room is definitely not the TARGET ROOM, choose a direction from the available options: [&#x27;east&#x27;, &#x27;south&#x27;]<br/>reply strictly with -<br/>MOVE: chosen direction<br/><br/>What action do you choose?<br/><br/>You must follow the above format rules exactly.<br/>Do not respond in any other format.
