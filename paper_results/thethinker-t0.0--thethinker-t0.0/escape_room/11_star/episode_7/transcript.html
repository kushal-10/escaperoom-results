        <p>&lt;think&gt;I&#x27;m looking at an image of what appears to be a reception or information desk area for The University of Vermont. Let me describe the TARGET ROOM as shown in the image:<br/><br/>The image shows a reception area with &quot;The University of Vermont&quot; written prominently at the top. The room has a light, warm color scheme with beige walls and wooden elements. There&#x27;s a reception desk with a light wood finish. On the desk, I can see what appears to be a computer monitor, some papers, and possibly a phone. There&#x27;s a decorative lamp on the left side of the desk area. <br/><br/>On the wall behind the desk, there&#x27;s a framed picture or artwork showing what looks like a tower or bell tower, which appears to be a university landmark. There&#x27;s a door visible on the left side of the image, and the overall lighting is warm and welcoming. The desk has a counter with what appears to be informational materials or brochures. There are also some small displays or stands with what might be brochures or information materials.<br/><br/>This appears to be a university reception or information center, likely the front desk or welcome area for visitors to The University of Vermont.&lt;/think&gt;&lt;answer&gt;DESCRIPTION: This is a reception area for The University of Vermont. The room features a light wood reception desk with a counter area. Above the desk, &quot;The University of Vermont&quot; is prominently displayed. The walls are painted in a warm beige tone. There&#x27;s a framed artwork of what appears to be a tower or bell tower on the wall behind the desk. The desk has a computer monitor, papers, and what looks like a phone. A decorative yellow lamp sits on the left side of the desk area. There&#x27;s a wooden door visible on the left side of the room, and the overall lighting creates a warm, welcoming atmosphere. The desk counter has informational materials and small display stands with brochures or information. The room has a professional yet inviting appearance typical of a university welcome center.&lt;/answer&gt;</p>

If the current room exactly matches the TARGET ROOM based on my description, respond strictly with -<br/>ESCAPE<br/><br/>2. If the current room seems similar but you are uncertain, ask me a clarifying question, reply strictly with -<br/>QUESTION: your question<br/><br/>3. If the current room is definitely not the TARGET ROOM, choose a direction from the available options: [&#x27;north&#x27;]<br/>reply strictly with -<br/>MOVE: chosen direction<br/><br/>Here is the description of the TARGET ROOM:<br/>description: this is a reception area for the university of vermont. the room features a light wood reception desk with a counter area. above the desk, &quot;the university of vermont&quot; is prominently displayed. the walls are painted in a warm beige tone. there&#x27;s a framed artwork of what appears to be a tower or bell tower on the wall behind the desk. the desk has a computer monitor, papers, and what looks like a phone. a decorative yellow lamp sits on the left side of the desk area. there&#x27;s a wooden door visible on the left side of the room, and the overall lighting creates a warm, welcoming atmosphere. the desk counter has informational materials and small display stands with brochures or information. the room has a professional yet inviting appearance typical of a university welcome center.<br/>What action do you choose?<br/><br/>You must follow the above format rules exactly.<br/>Do not respond in any other format.

        <p>&lt;think&gt;Got it, let&#x27;s analyze the current room image. The current room shows a home theater or entertainment room with purple walls, a large screen showing a basketball game, couches, and a modern ceiling design. This doesn&#x27;t match the target room description at all, which is a university reception area with a desk, warm beige walls, etc. So since it&#x27;s not the target room, I need to move. But wait, the directions available—wait, the action is to choose a direction. But the image doesn&#x27;t show directions labeled, but maybe I need to move. Wait, the current room is definitely not the target. So I should respond with MOVE: [direction]. But which direction? Wait, the problem says &quot;choose a direction from the available options&quot; but the image doesn&#x27;t show directions. Wait, maybe the standard is to pick a direction, but since the image doesn&#x27;t show exits, maybe I need to assume. But the key is that the current room is not the target, so I need to move. Let me check the description again. The target is a reception area with desk, beige walls, etc. Current room is a theater with purple walls, couches, TV. So definitely not. So respond with MOVE: [direction]. Let&#x27;s pick north as an example, but maybe any direction. Wait, the format requires &quot;reply strictly with - MOVE: chosen direction&quot;. So I need to pick a direction. Let&#x27;s say north.&lt;/think&gt;&lt;answer&gt;MOVE: north&lt;/answer&gt;</p>

        <p>&lt;think&gt;Got it, let&#x27;s analyze the current room. The image shows a bedroom with a bed, lamps, a nightstand, and a cozy setup. The target room is a university reception area with a desk, warm beige walls, etc. This bedroom doesn&#x27;t match at all. So since it&#x27;s not the target room, I need to move. The available directions are south, north, east, west. Let&#x27;s pick one, say north. So the response should be MOVE: north.&lt;/think&gt;&lt;answer&gt;MOVE: north<br/>&lt;/answer&gt;</p>

        <p>&lt;think&gt;Got it, let&#x27;s check if the current room matches the target description. The target description says: &quot;this is a reception area for the university of vermont. the room features a light wood reception desk with a counter area. above the desk, &#x27;the university of vermont&#x27; is prominently displayed. the walls are painted in a warm beige tone. there&#x27;s a framed artwork of what appears to be a tower or bell tower on the wall behind the desk. the desk has a computer monitor, papers, and what looks like a phone. a decorative yellow lamp sits on the left side of the desk area. there&#x27;s a wooden door visible on the left side of the room, and the overall lighting creates a warm, welcoming atmosphere. the desk counter has informational materials and small display stands with brochures or information. the room has a professional yet inviting appearance typical of a university welcome center.&quot;<br/><br/>Looking at the current image: there&#x27;s &quot;The University of Vermont&quot; text, light wood reception desk, warm beige walls, a framed tower artwork (the green one with the tower), a yellow lamp on the left, a wooden door on the left, desk with computer, papers, etc. All elements match. So this is the target room. Therefore, respond with ESCAPE.&lt;/think&gt;&lt;answer&gt;ESCAPE<br/>&lt;/answer&gt;</p>
