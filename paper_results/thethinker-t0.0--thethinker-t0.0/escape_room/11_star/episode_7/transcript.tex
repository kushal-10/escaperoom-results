	 <think>Got it, let's analyze the current room image. The current room shows a home theater or entertainment room with purple walls, a large screen showing a basketball game, couches, and a modern ceiling design. This doesn't match the target room description at all, which is a university reception area with a desk, warm beige walls, etc. So since it's not the target room, I need to move. But wait, the directions available—wait, the action is to choose a direction. But the image doesn't show directions labeled, but maybe I need to move. Wait, the current room is definitely not the target. So I should respond with MOVE: [direction]. But which direction? Wait, the problem says "choose a direction from the available options" but the image doesn't show directions. Wait, maybe the standard is to pick a direction, but since the image doesn't show exits, maybe I need to assume. But the key is that the current room is not the target, so I need to move. Let me check the description again. The target is a reception area with desk, beige walls, etc. Current room is a theater with purple walls, couches, TV. So definitely not. So respond with MOVE: [direction]. Let's pick north as an example, but maybe any direction. Wait, the format requires "reply strictly with - MOVE: chosen direction". So I need to pick a direction. Let's say north.</think><answer>MOVE: north</answer>
