Let&#x27;s structure the description.<br/><br/>First, identify the main elements: furniture (table, chairs), decor (wall art, lamp, bookshelf items), windows, flooring.

    <div speaker="Player 2 (Explorer) to Game Master" class="msg b-gm" style="">
        <p>&lt;think&gt;Got it, let&#x27;s analyze the current room and the target room description. The target is a dining room with specific elements: wooden table, black chairs, hardwood flooring, window with red blinds, bookshelf with items, wall hanging, lamp, potted plant. The current image shows a home theater with a big screen, speakers, and what looks like a media room setup. This doesn&#x27;t match the dining room description at all. So I need to move in a direction. Since the current room isn&#x27;t the target, I should choose a direction. Let&#x27;s pick one, maybe south? Wait, the action should be MOVE: direction. So the response would be MOVE: [direction]. Let me check the image again. The room has a large screen, speakers, media shelves, not dining elements. So definitely not the target. Therefore, move in any direction, say south.&lt;/think&gt;&lt;answer&gt;MOVE: south&lt;/answer&gt;</p>

The target is a dining room with wooden table, black chairs, hardwood flooring, window with red blinds, bookshelf with items, wall hanging, lamp, potted plant.

The current room is definitely not the target, so move in one of those directions. Let&#x27;s say north. Then the response would be MOVE: north. Wait, need to make sure the action format is correct.

        <p>&lt;think&gt;Got it, let&#x27;s analyze the current room and the target description. The target is a dining room with specific elements: wooden table, black chairs, hardwood flooring, window with red blinds, bookshelf with framed photos, cups, books, decorative items, colorful wall hanging, lamp, potted plant near corner. The current image shows a home theater with a large screen, speakers, media shelves, and what looks like a media room setup. This doesn&#x27;t match the dining room description at all. The options for direction are [&#x27;south&#x27;, &#x27;north&#x27;, &#x27;east&#x27;, &#x27;west&#x27;]. Since the current room is definitely not the target, I need to move. Let&#x27;s choose a direction, say south. So the response would be MOVE: south. Wait, but the image is the same as the first one. So again, not the target. So move in south. So the action is MOVE: south.&lt;/think&gt;&lt;answer&gt;MOVE: south<br/>&lt;/answer&gt;</p>

        <p>Now you made a move to this room, you can choose one of the following three actions:<br/><br/>1. If the current room exactly matches the TARGET ROOM based on my description, respond strictly with -<br/>ESCAPE<br/><br/>2. If the current room seems similar but you are uncertain, ask me a clarifying question, reply strictly with -<br/>QUESTION: your question<br/><br/>3. If the current room is definitely not the TARGET ROOM, choose a direction from the available options: [&#x27;north&#x27;, &#x27;south&#x27;]<br/>reply strictly with -<br/>MOVE: chosen direction<br/><br/>What action do you choose?<br/><br/>You must follow the above format rules exactly.<br/>Do not respond in any other format. Do not provide any commentary or clarification.<br/><br/></p>
