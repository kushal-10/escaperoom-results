	 <think>Got it, let's analyze the current room image. The description of the TARGET ROOM is a reception area with wooden paneling, a wooden counter, mirror, people interacting, informational materials, phone. The current image shows a reception desk area but let's check details. The current room has a curved counter, wooden cabinets, but does it match the TARGET's elements? The TARGET has a mirror, people, informational materials, phone. The current image doesn't show a mirror, people, or those specific elements. So it's not the TARGET. Now, need to choose direction. But wait, the current room's layout—do we have direction options? The question says "choose a direction from the available options: ['west', 'east']". But first, check if the current room is not TARGET. So respond with MOVE: direction. But which direction? Wait, the image shows the room layout. Let's see. The current room has a counter, maybe the TARGET is not here. So since it's not the TARGET, move. But which direction? Wait, maybe the current room is not the TARGET, so move. But the options are west or east. Let's check the image. The room has a counter, maybe the TARGET is in another direction. But since the current room doesn't match, move. Let's pick one direction, say west. Wait, but need to follow the format. So the action is MOVE: west (or east, but need to pick). Wait, the image shows the room with the counter. If the TARGET is not here, move. So the response is MOVE: west (or east, either is fine as long as it's one of the options).</think><answer>MOVE: west</answer>
