        <p>&lt;think&gt;Got it, let&#x27;s look at the image. The TARGET ROOM is a recording studio. There&#x27;s a large mixing console with many knobs and sliders. There are speakers on either side of the console. There&#x27;s a computer with a monitor, some audio equipment racks on the left, a chair in front of the console, and wooden walls with some decorations like a tapestry and a wreath. The floor is wooden. So I need to describe the room as a recording studio with the equipment.&lt;/think&gt;&lt;answer&gt;DESCRIPTION: A recording studio with a large audio mixing console at the center, surrounded by various audio equipment racks, speakers, a computer with a monitor, and wooden walls adorned with decorative elements like a tapestry and a wreath. The room has wooden flooring and professional audio equipment throughout.&lt;/answer&gt;</p>

        <p>You are the SEEKER in MapWorld, a network of interconnected rooms.<br/><br/>Your objective is to find and reach the TARGET ROOM.<br/><br/>I have the image of the TARGET ROOM and will describe it to you.<br/><br/>At each step, you will be shown an image of your current room.<br/><br/>You may perform only one of the following actions:<br/><br/>1. If the current room exactly matches the TARGET ROOM based on my description, respond strictly with -<br/>ESCAPE<br/><br/>2. If the current room seems similar but you are uncertain, ask me a clarifying question, reply strictly with -<br/>QUESTION: your question<br/><br/>3. If the current room is definitely not the TARGET ROOM, choose a direction from the available options: [&#x27;west&#x27;, &#x27;east&#x27;]<br/>reply strictly with -<br/>MOVE: chosen direction<br/><br/>Here is the description of the TARGET ROOM:<br/>description: a recording studio with a large audio mixing console at the center, surrounded by various audio equipment racks, speakers, a computer with a monitor, and wooden walls adorned with decorative elements like a tapestry and a wreath. the room has wooden flooring and professional audio equipment throughout.<br/>What action do you choose?<br/><br/>You must follow the above format rules exactly.<br/>Do not respond in any other format.

    <div speaker="Player 2 (Explorer) to Game Master" class="msg b-gm" style="">
        <p>&lt;think&gt;Let me analyze the current room image and compare it with the target room description.<br/><br/>Target room description:<br/>- A recording studio with a large audio mixing console at the center<br/>- Surrounded by various audio equipment racks<br/>- Speakers<br/>- A computer with a monitor<br/>- Wooden walls adorned with decorative elements like a tapestry and a wreath<br/>- Wooden flooring<br/>- Professional audio equipment throughout<br/><br/>Current room image:<br/>- I see a recording studio with a large audio mixing console<br/>- There are audio equipment racks<br/>- There are speakers<br/>- There appears to be a computer with a monitor<br/>- The walls appear to be gray acoustic panels, not wooden walls<br/>- The flooring appears to be carpeted, not wooden<br/>- There don&#x27;t seem to be decorative elements like tapestries or wreaths visible<br/>- There is a person sitting at the console<br/><br/>Comparing the current room to the target room:<br/>- The core elements (mixing console, audio equipment, speakers, computer) match<br/>- However, the walls are not wooden (they appear to be gray acoustic panels)<br/>- The flooring is not wooden (appears to be carpet)<br/>- There are no visible decorative elements like tapestries or wreaths<br/>- The overall aesthetic doesn&#x27;t match the wooden walls and flooring described<br/><br/>Since the current room doesn&#x27;t exactly match the target room description (specifically the wooden walls, wooden flooring, and decorative elements), I should move in one of the directions. The available directions are &#x27;west&#x27; and &#x27;east&#x27;.<br/><br/>However, I need to check if I should ask a question or move. The room is similar but has differences in the wall and floor materials, and decorative elements. Since I&#x27;m not certain if this is the exact target room, I could either ask for clarification or move.<br/><br/>Given the differences, I think I should move rather than ask a question, as the room is close but not exactly matching.&lt;/think&gt;&lt;answer&gt;MOVE: east<br/>&lt;/answer&gt;</p>
