If the current room exactly matches the TARGET ROOM based on my description, respond strictly with -<br/>ESCAPE<br/><br/>2. If the current room seems similar but you are uncertain, ask me a clarifying question, reply strictly with -<br/>QUESTION: your question<br/><br/>3.

    <div speaker="Player 2 (Explorer) to Game Master" class="msg b-gm" style="">
        <p>&lt;think&gt;Got it, let&#x27;s analyze the current room. The target room is described as a spacious room with wooden flooring and furniture, large windows with greenery view, wooden desks with chairs, pendant lights, bright open atmosphere. The current room has a bed, a small nightstand, a dresser, and a window, but it&#x27;s more like a bedroom with a bed, not desks or pendant lights. So it&#x27;s definitely not the target room. The options are west or east. Let me check the layout. The current room doesn&#x27;t match the target&#x27;s description, so I need to move. Let&#x27;s pick a direction, maybe west or east. But first, confirm it&#x27;s not the target. So the action should be MOVE with a direction.&lt;/think&gt;&lt;answer&gt;MOVE: west&lt;/answer&gt;</p>
