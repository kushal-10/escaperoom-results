	 <think>Got it, let's analyze the current room image. The image shows a room with computer desks, monitors, and what looks like a library or computer lab setting. The target room is a formal dining room with a large table, chandelier, column, etc. So the current room doesn't match. Therefore, I need to choose a direction. But first, check if the current room is not the target. So the action would be MOVE with a direction. Let's pick a direction, maybe south? Wait, but the image doesn't show directions clearly, but since it's not the target, move. So reply with MOVE: [direction]. Let's choose south, for example.</think><answer>MOVE: south</answer>
