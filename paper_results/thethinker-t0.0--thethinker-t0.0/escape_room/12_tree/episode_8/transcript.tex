	 <think>Got it, let's look at the image. The TARGET ROOM is a small room with white walls, a carpeted floor, a shelf with some items, and a ceiling light. Let me describe it properly. The room has a simple layout, maybe a storage or utility room. The walls are plain white, the floor is light gray carpet. There's a metal shelf on one wall with what looks like a small appliance or container, and a fluorescent light fixture on the ceiling. The door frame is visible, so it's a small enclosed space.</think><answer>DESCRIPTION: A small room with white walls, a light gray carpeted floor, a ceiling-mounted fluorescent light, and a metal shelf on one wall holding a small appliance or container.

The current room is a lobby, not the TARGET's storage/utility space. So move. Let's do MOVE: west. Wait, but let me confirm. The current room is definitely not the TARGET, so move. So the action is MOVE with a direction. Let's choose west. So <|begin_of_box|>MOVE: west<|end_of_box|> (or any of the options, but need to pick one).
