The target room description is \"a room with a large rectangular table surrounded by several chairs. there is a decorative centerpiece on the table, light-colored walls, windows with curtains, and the room has a modern, bright interior with wall sconces.\" \n\nLooking at the current image: there are chairs (several), tables (though maybe not large rectangular, but there are seating areas), light-colored walls (beige), windows with curtains (the large windows with glass doors), and the interior seems bright. Wait, does this match? Let's check each element. The room has chairs, tables, light walls, windows with curtains, and a bright interior. The description mentions a large rectangular table, but maybe the seating arrangement is similar. The current room has multiple seating areas with chairs, light walls, windows with curtains, and a bright interior. So does this match the target room? Let's see. The target has a large rectangular table, chairs, centerpiece, light walls, windows with curtains, modern bright interior. The current room has chairs, tables (maybe not large rectangular, but seating areas), light walls, windows with curtains, bright interior. So maybe this is the target room? Wait, let's check again. The image shows a room with chairs, tables, light walls, windows with curtains, and a bright interior. The description of the target room matches these elements. So if it's the target room, respond with ESCAPE. But wait, let me confirm. The target has a large rectangular table, chairs, centerpiece, light walls, windows with curtains, modern bright interior.
