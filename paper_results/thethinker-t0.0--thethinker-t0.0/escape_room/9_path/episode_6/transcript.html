        <p>&lt;think&gt;Got it, let&#x27;s look at the image. The TARGET ROOM is a library or study area with wooden tables, bookshelves, lamps, and people studying. Let&#x27;s describe the elements: rows of wooden tables with lamps, bookshelves filled with books, people sitting and reading, ceiling with lights, large windows maybe, and a quiet academic atmosphere. So the description should capture the setting.&lt;/think&gt;&lt;answer&gt;DESCRIPTION: A spacious library or study room with rows of wooden tables, each equipped with a desk lamp. The room is filled with bookshelves packed with books, and several people are seated at the tables studying. The ceiling has exposed beams and numerous lights, while large windows allow natural light to filter in, creating a quiet, academic atmosphere.&lt;/answer&gt;</p>

It&#x27;s a hotel room/bedroom with beds, not a library or study room with rows of tables and bookshelves.\n- The room has a completely different function and layout than the target description.\n\nSince the only available direction is [&#x27;west&#x27;], I need to move in that direction. The current room is not the target room, so I should move west to find the target room.&lt;|end_of_box|&gt;}]}]&lt;/answer&gt;</p>
