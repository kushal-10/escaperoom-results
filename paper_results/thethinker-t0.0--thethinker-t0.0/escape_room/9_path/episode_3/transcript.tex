The target room is described as a cozy living room with warm beige walls, tiled flooring, yellow-accented furniture, yellow sofa, wooden chairs with yellow throws, coffee table, dark door left, window with floral curtains right, hanging lamp, abstract painting. The current room has light blue walls, wooden flooring, a dining area with dark chairs, a fireplace, and large windows to a deck. This doesn't match the target description at all. So the current room is not the target, so I need to move. The options are west or south. Let's check the options. The action should be MOVE: chosen direction. Let's pick one, maybe west or south.
