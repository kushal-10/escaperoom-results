        <p>&lt;think&gt;Got it, let&#x27;s look at the image. The TARGET ROOM has a warm, cozy feel. There&#x27;s a yellow sofa with cushions, wooden chairs with yellow throws, a wooden coffee table, a dark door on the left, a window with floral curtains on the right, a painting on the wall, and tiled flooring. Let&#x27;s structure the description.<br/><br/>First, identify elements: furniture (sofa, chairs, coffee table), decor (painting, curtains, lamp), color scheme (yellow, brown, beige), layout (rooms with furniture arrangement). So the description should capture the key features.&lt;/think&gt;&lt;answer&gt;DESCRIPTION: A cozy living room with warm beige walls, tiled flooring, and yellow-accented furniture.

If the current room exactly matches the TARGET ROOM based on my description, respond strictly with -<br/>ESCAPE<br/><br/>2. If the current room seems similar but you are uncertain, ask me a clarifying question, reply strictly with -<br/>QUESTION: your question<br/><br/>3. If the current room is definitely not the TARGET ROOM, choose a direction from the available options: [&#x27;west&#x27;, &#x27;south&#x27;]<br/>reply strictly with -<br/>MOVE: chosen direction<br/><br/>Here is the description of the TARGET ROOM:<br/>description: a cozy living room with warm beige walls, tiled flooring, and yellow-accented furniture. there is a yellow sofa with cushions, wooden chairs with yellow throws, a wooden coffee table, a dark door on the left, a window with floral curtains on the right, a hanging lamp, and an abstract painting on the wall.<br/>What action do you choose?<br/><br/>You must follow the above format rules exactly.<br/>Do not respond in any other format.

    <div speaker="Player 2 (Explorer) to Game Master" class="msg b-gm" style="">
        <p>&lt;think&gt;Got it, let&#x27;s analyze the current room image. The target room is described as a cozy living room with warm beige walls, tiled flooring, yellow-accented furniture, yellow sofa, wooden chairs with yellow throws, coffee table, dark door left, window with floral curtains right, hanging lamp, abstract painting. The current room has light blue walls, wooden flooring, a dining area with dark chairs, a fireplace, and large windows to a deck. This doesn&#x27;t match the target description at all. So the current room is not the target, so I need to move. The options are west or south. Let&#x27;s check the options. The action should be MOVE: chosen direction. Let&#x27;s pick one, maybe west or south. But first, confirm the current room doesn&#x27;t match. So reply with MOVE: west (or south, either is fine as long as it&#x27;s one of the options).&lt;/think&gt;&lt;answer&gt;MOVE: west&lt;/answer&gt;</p>
