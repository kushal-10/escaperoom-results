	 <think>Got it, let's analyze the current room image. The image shows a person painting, with an easel, windows, and what looks like an art studio or a room with a different setup. The target room is a bedroom with specific features like a bed, nightstands, windows with shutters, etc. This current room doesn't match the target description at all. So I need to move in one of the directions. But wait, the directions are east or west. Since the current room isn't the target, I should move. But first, check if I need to ask a question? No, because it's definitely not the target. So move in a direction. Let me pick one, maybe east or west. But the format says to reply with MOVE: direction. So I'll choose a direction.</think><answer>MOVE: east</answer>
