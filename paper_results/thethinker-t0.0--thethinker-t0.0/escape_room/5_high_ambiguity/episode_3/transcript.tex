	 <think>Got it, let's look at the image. The TARGET ROOM is a recording studio or control room. There's a desk with audio equipment, like a keyboard, monitors, and computers. There are two black office chairs, one near the desk and one near the left wall. The walls have sound-absorbing panels, maybe for acoustics. There's a large TV mounted on the wall showing a cityscape. The lighting is from ceiling track lights, and the floor has a patterned carpet. The overall setup suggests a professional audio or video editing space. So I need to describe that.</think><answer>DESCRIPTION: A recording studio or control room with audio equipment including a keyboard, computer monitors, and audio interfaces.

	 <think>Got it, let's analyze the current room image. The current room has wooden shelves with baskets, board games, books, a bench with a pillow, toys like a red car and remote. This doesn't match the target room description at all. The target is a recording studio with audio equipment, chairs, sound panels, etc. So the current room is not the target. I need to move, but the directions are west or east. Since the image doesn't show directions, but I need to choose one. Let me check the format. The action should be MOVE: direction.
