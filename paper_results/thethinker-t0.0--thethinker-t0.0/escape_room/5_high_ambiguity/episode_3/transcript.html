        <p>&lt;think&gt;Got it, let&#x27;s look at the image. The TARGET ROOM is a recording studio or control room. There&#x27;s a desk with audio equipment, like a keyboard, monitors, and computers. There are two black office chairs, one near the desk and one near the left wall. The walls have sound-absorbing panels, maybe for acoustics. There&#x27;s a large TV mounted on the wall showing a cityscape. The lighting is from ceiling track lights, and the floor has a patterned carpet. The overall setup suggests a professional audio or video editing space. So I need to describe that.&lt;/think&gt;&lt;answer&gt;DESCRIPTION: A recording studio or control room with audio equipment including a keyboard, computer monitors, and audio interfaces. There are two black office chairs, sound-absorbing panels on the walls, a large wall-mounted TV displaying a cityscape, ceiling track lighting, and a patterned carpet on the floor.&lt;/answer&gt;</p>

        <p>You are the SEEKER in MapWorld, a network of interconnected rooms.<br/><br/>Your objective is to find and reach the TARGET ROOM.<br/><br/>I have the image of the TARGET ROOM and will describe it to you.<br/><br/>At each step, you will be shown an image of your current room.<br/><br/>You may perform only one of the following actions:<br/><br/>1. If the current room exactly matches the TARGET ROOM based on my description, respond strictly with -<br/>ESCAPE<br/><br/>2. If the current room seems similar but you are uncertain, ask me a clarifying question, reply strictly with -<br/>QUESTION: your question<br/><br/>3. If the current room is definitely not the TARGET ROOM, choose a direction from the available options: [&#x27;west&#x27;, &#x27;east&#x27;]<br/>reply strictly with -<br/>MOVE: chosen direction<br/><br/>Here is the description of the TARGET ROOM:<br/>description: a recording studio or control room with audio equipment including a keyboard, computer monitors, and audio interfaces. there are two black office chairs, sound-absorbing panels on the walls, a large wall-mounted tv displaying a cityscape, ceiling track lighting, and a patterned carpet on the floor.<br/>What action do you choose?<br/><br/>You must follow the above format rules exactly.<br/>Do not respond in any other format.

    <div speaker="Player 2 (Explorer) to Game Master" class="msg b-gm" style="">
        <p>&lt;think&gt;Got it, let&#x27;s analyze the current room image. The current room has wooden shelves with baskets, board games, books, a bench with a pillow, toys like a red car and remote. This doesn&#x27;t match the target room description at all. The target is a recording studio with audio equipment, chairs, sound panels, etc. So the current room is not the target. I need to move, but the directions are west or east. Since the image doesn&#x27;t show directions, but I need to choose one. Let me check the format. The action should be MOVE: direction. So I&#x27;ll pick one, maybe west or east. But the image doesn&#x27;t show exits, but since I need to move, I&#x27;ll choose a direction.&lt;/think&gt;&lt;answer&gt;MOVE: west<br/>&lt;/answer&gt;</p>

Definitely not the target room. So I need to move. The directions are west or east. Let&#x27;s choose one. Maybe west.

        <p>&lt;think&gt;Got it, let&#x27;s check the current room against the target description. The target has audio equipment (keyboard, computer monitors, audio interfaces), two black office chairs, sound-absorbing panels, a large wall-mounted TV with cityscape, ceiling track lighting, and a patterned carpet. The current room has a keyboard, computer monitors, audio interfaces (the equipment under the desk), two black office chairs, sound-absorbing panels (the large panels on the walls), a large wall-mounted TV showing a cityscape, ceiling track lighting (the track lights on the ceiling), and a patterned carpet (the floor has a patterned look).
