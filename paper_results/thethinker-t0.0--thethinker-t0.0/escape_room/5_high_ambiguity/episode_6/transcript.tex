	 <think>Got it, let's analyze the current room image. The image shows an office-like space with computers, a desk, and office equipment. The target room is a library with children, bookshelves, a red backpack, etc. This current room doesn't match the target description at all. So I need to move in a direction. Since the options are north or east, I'll pick one. Let's choose north, but wait, need to check if the current room is not the target. So the action should be MOVE: north (or east, either is fine as long as it's one of the options).</think><answer>MOVE: north</answer>
