	 <think>Got it, let's look at the image. The TARGET ROOM is a walk-in closet or wardrobe room. It has wooden built-in shelves and cabinets. There are hanging sections with clothes—light blue shirts on the left, then maybe pants or other clothes. The shelves have various storage boxes, baskets, and folded items. There's a large arched window on the right with white trim, letting in light. There's a bench with a cushioned seat near the window, and some hanging clothes on the right side too. The floor is carpeted, and the overall color scheme is warm with wood tones and soft lighting. So I need to describe that.</think><answer>DESCRIPTION: A walk - in closet with wooden built - in storage units. The space has hanging sections with clothes (including light blue shirts on the left and other garments), shelves filled with boxes, baskets, and folded items, a large arched window with white trim on the right allowing natural light, a cushioned bench near the window, and carpeted flooring. The room has an organized layout with various storage options and a cozy atmosphere.</answer>

	 <think>Got it, let's analyze the current room. The image shows a bedroom with a bed, nightstands, lamps, and a dark cabinet. The target room is described as a walk-in closet with wooden storage, hanging clothes, shelves, arched window, bench, carpeted flooring. This current room doesn't match at all. So I need to move in one of the directions. Since the options are west or east, I'll choose one. But first, confirm it's not the target. So the action should be MOVE with a direction.</think><answer>MOVE: west</answer>

The target is a walk-in closet with wooden built-in storage, hanging clothes (light blue shirts on left), shelves with boxes/baskets, large arched window with white trim, cushioned bench near window, carpeted flooring. The image shows wooden storage units, hanging clothes (light blue shirts on left), shelves with boxes, an arched window with white trim, a cushioned bench near the window, and carpeted flooring. All elements match. So the action is ESCAPE.</think><answer>ESCAPE\\ \tt </answer>
