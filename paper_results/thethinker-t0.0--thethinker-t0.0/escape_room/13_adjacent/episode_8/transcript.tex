	 <think>Got it, let's look at the image. The TARGET ROOM is a reception area, I think. There's a curved reception desk with a person standing there. The room has light green walls, a patterned sofa, a wooden coffee table, a floor lamp, and some plants. Let me describe the elements clearly.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, the layout: a curved reception desk (brownish-red) with a person in a black top. Then, there's a sofa with a floral pattern, a wooden coffee table in front of it, a tall floor lamp with a lampshade, some decorative plants (like a small tree), and the walls are light green with some lighting fixtures. The overall ambiance is warm and welcoming, typical of a hotel or office reception.</think><answer>DESCRIPTION: A reception area with a curved, brown reception desk where a person stands.

	 <think>Got it, let's analyze the current room image. The image shows a room with multiple computer monitors arranged around a circular table, which is a computer lab or workspace area. The TARGET ROOM is described as a reception area with a curved desk, light green walls, sofa, coffee table, lamp, plants, etc. This current room doesn't match at all. So I need to move, and the options are west or north. Since the current room is not the target, I'll choose a direction. Let's pick one, maybe west or north. But first, confirm it's not the target. So the action is MOVE: [direction]. Let's say west.</think><answer>MOVE: west</answer>

The description of the TARGET ROOM is a reception area with a curved brown desk, light green walls, floral sofa, wooden coffee table, tall floor lamp, decorative plants, warm lighting. The current image shows a curved reception desk (brown), light green walls, a patterned sofa (floral design), wooden coffee table, tall floor lamp, decorative plants, warm lighting. All elements match. So this is the TARGET ROOM. Therefore, respond with ESCAPE.</think><answer>ESCAPE\\ \tt </answer>
