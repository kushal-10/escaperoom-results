	 <think>Got it, let's analyze the current room image. The target room description is a bright room with white cabinetry, wooden countertop, dining table, large window with greenery view, light walls and wooden flooring. The current image shows a music studio with guitars, keyboards, equipment—no white cabinetry, dining table, or large window with greenery. So it's definitely not the target. Need to move. Let's check directions. The options are west or east. Since the current room doesn't match, move. Let's pick a direction, maybe west? Wait, the image doesn't show directions, but the action is to move. So reply with MOVE: west (or east, but need to choose one). Wait, the current room is a music studio, not the target. So move.</think><answer>MOVE: west</answer>
