Let's describe the elements: there are wooden bookshelves filled with books/magazines, two maroon patterned armchairs, a small wooden table with a lamp, large windows with natural light, and various plants. So the description should capture the layout and key features.\\ \tt \\ \tt DESCRIPTION: A cozy reading room with wooden bookshelves filled with books and magazines, two maroon patterned armchairs facing each other with a small wooden table between them holding a lamp and books, large windows on the left letting in natural light, and several potted plants adding greenery to the space.</think><answer>DESCRIPTION: A cozy reading room with wooden bookshelves filled with books and magazines, two maroon patterned armchairs facing each other with a small wooden table between them holding a lamp and books, large windows on the left letting in natural light, and several potted plants adding greenery to the space.</answer>

	 <think>Got it, let's analyze the current room image. The description of the target room is a cozy reading room with wooden bookshelves, maroon armchairs, small wooden table with lamp and books, large windows, potted plants. The current room has desks, computer monitors, office chairs, which doesn't match. So it's definitely not the target room. Now, need to choose direction. The options are west or north. Let's check the room layout. Since the current room is an office workspace, not the reading room, I need to move. Let's pick a direction, maybe west or north. Let's go with west.</think><answer>MOVE: west</answer>

The target has wooden bookshelves with books/magazines, two maroon armchairs facing each other with a small wooden table between them (holding lamp and books), large windows on the left, potted plants. The current room has wooden bookshelves filled with books/magazines, two maroon patterned armchairs facing each other with a small wooden table between them (has a lamp and books), large windows on the left (the window on the left has natural light), and several potted plants (there are plants like the large one on the left and the one in the bottom right).
